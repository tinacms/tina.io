## üßø Vision

Make a website to communicate the awesomeness of TinaCMS.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

Static web application built with...

## üõ†Ô∏è Dependency Installation + Setup

We're using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as the package manager for node.
  
```bash
cp .env.example .env
pnpm i
```

**Note**: Python is required for gyp ‚Äì install [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and if necessary (newer python versions) the [setup tools](https://stackoverflow.com/a/77638742).

## üßëüèª‚Äçüíª Running the Project
```bash
pnpm dev
```
This will spin up the react/Next project locally, running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (react app) and [localhost:4001](http://localhost:4001/graphql) (playground for testing graphql against the Tina datalayer).

## Not Familiar with Tina?

We've put together a simple explanation of the project directory ‚Äì in [_docs/Directory-Structure](_docs/Directory-Structure.md).

This should give you an idea of how it all fits into the project.

Additionally, the Tina [docs](https://tina.io/docs/) contains the usage details for development with Tina.
