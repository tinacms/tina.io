## Changes

### Deprecations

* **tinacms:** The `markdown` and `html` fields are no longer provided by default. In order to use them in your site you must include them manually. [See last week's notice for more information.](https://tinacms.org/blog/2020-05-19-release-notes#markdown-and-html-fields-as-default-plugins)

### Features

* **tinacms:** A default `tags` field is now available.
* **react-tinacms-inline:** The `InlineImageField` now accepts a `previewSrc` function.

### Bug Fixes

* **react-tinacms-github:** Fixed a bug where the working branch cookie was not set after authenticating
