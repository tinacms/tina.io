Today we are excited to release `tinacms@1.4.0` and `@tinacms/clil@1.4.0`. These new versions add a `match` property (used for including/excluding a subset of documents), a massive update to our CLI, and various bug fixes and other improvements. The full list of changes can be found [in the changeset PR](https://github.com/tinacms/tinacms/pull/3706 'Changeset pull request').

## The `match` property on a collection

The match property allows you to only include a subset of your documents in your collection.

For example,

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'tinacms'

export default defineConfig({
  schema: {
    collections: [
      {
        path: 'content/posts',
        match: {
          include: '*',
        },
        format: 'md',
      },
    ],
  },
})
```

This will not match on subdirectories. It will match `collections/posts/foo.md` but not `collections/posts/nested/bar.md`. Check out the [docs for more info](/docs/reference/collections/#matchinclude 'Match docs').

## CLI updates

The GraphQL playground is now hosted at `<YourDevUrl>/admin/index.html#/graphql` (It was previously on the same port as the local GraphQL server). This allows the playground to be used in production and allows us opportunity for more customization in the future.

## Other Updates

### Use Markdown parser by default on .md files

We are now going to use a markdown parser by default if format: 'md' is used. This means that if you are using markdown files that contain templates you will have to turn on the mdx parser on each field by doing:

```typescript
{
  type: 'rich-text',
  parser: {
      type: 'mdx',
  },
  //...
}
```

### New Content API endpoint

We have migrated our endpoint to a versioned endpoint. This likely does not require any action unless you are using [custom data fetching](/docs/reference/content-api/content-delivery/ 'Custom Data Fetching docs'). If you are using custom data fetching you will have to update the url from `/content/<ClientID>/github/<branch>` to `/<TinaGraphQLVersion>/content/<ClientID>/github/<branch>` where TinaGraphQL version is the `"\<major\>.\<minor\>"` version of the @tinacms/graphql package. So if you are using Tina `1.4.3`, the version would be `1.4`
