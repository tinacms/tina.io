The ability to integrate and manage Mermaid diagrams within TinaCMS is nearly here, offering more flexibility for content creators working with visual representations like flowcharts, sequence diagrams, and more. Hereâ€™s a look at where things stand with this feature and whatâ€™s coming next.

### Part 1: Plate.js Integration (Completed)

Mermaid diagrams are now fully integrated into the **Plate editor**. Using the `mermaid` package, diagrams can be edited and rendered directly within the editor.

### Part 2: Parsing and Saving Mermaid Diagrams (In Progress)

The next phase focuses on **parsing and saving** these diagrams. Since TinaCMS uses customized `mdast`, the challenge lies in ensuring the Mermaid syntax is correctly parsed, saved, and reloaded without issues.

### Whatâ€™s Next?

Next steps include polishing the parsing and saving process and rolling out the final deployment. This will be coming in the 2.3.0 release of `tinacms`. Once thatâ€™s done, you will be able to fully integrate, edit, and save Mermaid diagrams within TinaCMS ðŸ¦™
