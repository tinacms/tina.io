We are currently investigating an issue where the [Vercel Data Cache](https://vercel.com/docs/data-cache) is preventing content updates from appearing on some Next.js websites using TinaCMS and being hosted via Vercel.

While this caching mechanism provides a performance boost, we‚Äôve observed that in certain cases, content changes are not being reflected as expected due to the cache store.

We‚Äôre actively looking into this and will share updates as we learn more. If you‚Äôre experiencing this issue, please reach out via the [Tina Discord](https://discord.com/invite/zumN63Ybpf) or follow [this Discord thread](https://discord.com/channels/835168149439643678/1347442059279204422) for further developments.

Thanks for your patience! üõ†Ô∏è
