This is Part 2 of David Konsumer's guide to setting up and customizing TinaCMS. If you missed [part 1](https://tina.io/blog/getting-started-with-tinacms/), you should start there first.

In this video, David shows how to:

- Hide buttons in the toolbar of the [rich text editor](https://tina.io/docs/reference/types/rich-text/) (00:00)
- Add an embeddable Tweet component to the rich text editor (5:40)
- Add content blocks to his "rows" (13:30)
- Render those content blocks to his Next.js page (22:17)
- Setup a [Cloudinary integration](https://tina.io/docs/reference/media/external/cloudinary/) to use with the media manager (32:30)
