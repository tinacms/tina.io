Introducing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Support in TinaCloud

We’re thrilled to announce that TinaCloud now supports Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), adding an extra layer of security to your account. With this new feature, you can further protect your data and ensure that only you have access to your account.

### How Does MFA Work in TinaCloud?

#### For Email Logins

TinaCloud’s MFA is available for accounts using email logins. Once you enable MFA, you’ll need to provide a second factor of authentication in addition to your password. This additional step uses a Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) generated by a compatible authenticator app, such as Google Authenticator, Authy, or 1Password.

#### For GitHub Logins

For users who log in via GitHub, MFA functionality is managed directly through GitHub. If you haven’t already, we highly recommend enabling MFA on your GitHub account to secure your login. TinaCloud integrates seamlessly with GitHub’s existing MFA system, ensuring a secure connection.

### How to Enable MFA

Setting up MFA is quick and straightforward:

1. Log in to your TinaCloud account using your email and password.
2. Navigate to your Account Settings and find the Multi-Factor Authentication section.
3. Follow the prompts to scan a QR code using your preferred TOTP app.
4. Enter the code generated by your app to complete the setup.

### Why Enable MFA?

Adding MFA to your account significantly enhances security by requiring a second form of verification. Even if someone manages to obtain your password, they won’t be able to access your account without the authentication code from your TOTP app.

We’re committed to ensuring your account’s security and will continue to improve TinaCloud’s features to meet your needs. If you have any questions or need assistance with setting up MFA, don’t hesitate to reach out to our support team.

Secure your account today by enabling MFA in TinaCloud! Stay tuned for more updates as we expand our security offerings.
