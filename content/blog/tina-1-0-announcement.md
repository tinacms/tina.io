We're excited to announce that TinaCMS has gone 1.0 and coming out of beta!

TinaCMS was announced over 3 years ago, and has matured greatly over that time.

In the early days of TinaCMS, there was a high bar for getting started. TinaCMS is now easier than ever to setup. With our [recent changes](https://tina.io/blog/upgrading-to-iframe/), TinaCMS now works with all frameworks, such as Next.js, Remix, Astro, Hugo, 11ty, and more!

TinaCMS's 1.0 release also means that we can now release under [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/), so that breaking changes will be easier to manage.

## Getting Started with TinaCMS

To try a Tina starter:

```bash
npx create-tina-app@latest
```

For existing sites, initialize TinaCMS with:

```bash
npx @tinacms/cli@latest init
```

You can check out the "getting started" docs for more info

> For existing Tina sites looking to migrate to the latest iframe-based changes, [see our migration doc here](https://tina.io/blog/upgrading-to-iframe/)

## New pricing in effect

Tina Cloud's new pricing will go into effect now that Tina is out of Beta. For organizations that were created during the beta phase, pricing will go into effect on December 1st.
