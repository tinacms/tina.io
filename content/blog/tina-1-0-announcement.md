We're excited to announce that TinaCMS has gone 1.0!

TinaCMS was announced over 3 years ago, and has matured greatly over that time.

In the early days of TinaCMS, there was a high bar for getting started. TinaCMS is now framework agnostic, and is now easier than ever to setup.

TinaCMS's 1.0 release also means that we can now release under [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/), so that breaking changes will be easier to manage/

## Getting Started with TinaCMS

To try a Tina starter:

```bash
npx create-tina-app@latest
```

For existing sites, initialize TinaCMS with:

```bash
npx @tinacms/cli@latest init
```

> Check out the "getting started" docs for more info

For existing Tina sites looking to migrate to the latest iframe-based changes, [see our migration doc here](https://tina.io/blog/upgrading-to-iframe/)

## New pricing in effect

Tina's new pricing will go into effect now that Tina is out of Beta.
