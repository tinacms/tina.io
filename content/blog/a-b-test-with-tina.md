A/B testing is an important part of any site, it allows you to increase user engagement, reduce bounce rates, increase conversion rate and effectively create content. 

Tina opens the ability to easily power any site A/B testing, allowing marketing teams to test content without the need for the development team, once it has been implemented. 

## Create A/B testing with Tina.

We are going to break this tutorial into three sections:

1. Update the Tina schema to create a way to add new tests.
2. Create a method to decide how a user will see a variant.
3. Use Next.js Middleware to redirect the user to the correct variant

### Creating our Tina application

This blog post is going to use the Tina Cloud Starter,  use the `create-tina-app` command for that, when prompted select your package manager of choice, and then use Tailwind Starter:

```bash
# create our Tina application
 
npx create-tina-app@latest a-b-testing

✔ Which package manager would you like to use? › Yarn
✔ What starter code would you like to use? › Tailwind Starter
Downloading files from repo tinacms/tina-cloud-starter. This might take a moment.
Installing packages. This might take a couple of minutes.

## Move into the directory and make sure everything is up to date.

cd a-b-testing

yarn upgrade
  
```

Now we have our application ready you can check out the code and launch it using `yarn dev` or `npm run dev` depending on your package manager. Now we need to update our code so are pages can be driven by A/B testing.

### Updating Tina Schema

We are going to have a collection that will allow our content teams to decide what page is going to be replaced. This is what the user will see: 

![A-B Test page one](https://res.cloudinary.com/forestry-demo/image/upload/v1653521516/blog-media/a-b-testing/a-b-test1.png)

The ID will allow the content team to identify the A/B test and the Page field will be the page that the team wants to run the testing on, in this example, it would be the homepage. 

Then all the variants a user wants to run will be a list of different variants, for example, we have test `b` that will show a user page named `home-b` 

![A-B Test page two](https://res.cloudinary.com/forestry-demo/image/upload/v1653521516/blog-media/a-b-testing/a-b-test2.png)

Open up your `schema.ts` and underneath the `Pages` collection create a new collection with a `label` of `AB Test` and a name of `abtest`. So far your collection should look like this:

```jsx
{
      label: "AB Test",
      name: "abtest",
}
```

Then we need to set the path for the A/B test content we can set that to `content/ab-tests` and set the format to JSON. 

```jsx
{
      label: "AB Test",
      name: "abtest",
      path: "content/ab-tests",
      format: "json",
}
```

We now need to add are fields we want our content team to be able to edit, so that would be the ID, the page to run the test against, and the variants we want to run. We also want to be able to run tests on any number of pages so we will be using a list of objects. 


> If you want to learn more about all the different field types and how to use them, check them out in our [Content Modeling documentation.](https://tina.io/docs/schema/)


```json
fields: [
        {
          type: "object",
          label: "tests",
          name: "tests",
          list: true,
          ui: {
            itemProps: (item) => {
              return { label: item.testId };
            },
          },
          fields: [
            { type: "string", label: "Id", name: "testId" },
            {
              type: "string",
              label: "Page",
              name: "href",
              description:
                "This is the root page that will be conditionally swapped out",
            },
            {
              type: "object",
              name: "variants",
              label: "Variants",
              ui: {
                itemProps: (item) => {
                  return { label: item.testId };
                },
              },
              list: true,
              fields: [
                { type: "string", label: "Id", name: "testId" },
                {
                  type: "string",
                  label: "Page",
                  name: "href",
                  description:
                    "This is the variant page that will be conditionally used instead of the original",
                },
              ],
            },
          ],
        },
      ],
```


> You may notice the `ui` prop, we are using this to give a more descriptive label of the lists. Otherwise, each one would be `AB Test Item` you can read about this in our [extending Tina documentation.](https://tina.io/docs/extending-tina/customize-list-ui/)


Now we have a schema we can use, go ahead and launch the server using `yarn dev` and navigate to `[https://localhost:3000/admin](https://localhost:3000/admin)` and create a test. 

The test you want to create for this demo is: 

1. Create a new file called `index`
2. Create a test id home
3. Page to replace will be `/`
4. Create a variant id of b, and the page will be `/home-b`

Below is an example of the process of creating a new test. 

<Youtube embedSrc={"https://res.cloudinary.com/forestry-demo/video/upload/v1653521516/blog-media/a-b-testing/a-b-testing-video.mp4"} />

### Adding the `home-b` page.

We need to add a home-b page to our application that we described in our a/b testing variant. To do that click pages on the left-hand side of the admin. Select the `Create New` button and give the filename `home-b` and add content to the page. 

We are now ready to create the code that will power our variant decisions. 

## Variant Code

The variant code is made of two parts:

1. a “random” value that maps to an array element
2. Returning the `ABTestResult`

So at the root of the project let us create a folder structure of `utils` and then folder `ab-test` inside the folder create a file called `getBucket.ts`

This `getBucket` is going to return a number to reference the bucket for which the user lands. We need to first randomly generate the number. Then use that number and the number of buckets, which is passed in as an array, available to decide what bucket they are in. 

For the random value, we are going to use `crypto` 
 

```json
function cryptoRandom() {
    return crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint32Array(1))[0] / (0xffffffff + 1)
  }
```

For our `getBucket` function, we are going to pass the array of options and use the `cryptoRandom` function we just wrote, to decide which bucket the user lands in. 

```json
export function getBucket(buckets: readonly string[]) {
    // Get a random number between 0 and 1
    let n = cryptoRandom() * 100
    // Get the percentage of each bucket
    let percentage = 100 / buckets.length
    // Loop through the buckets and see if the random number falls
    // within the range of the bucket
    return (
      buckets.find(() => {
        n -= percentage
        return n <= 0
      }) ?? buckets[0]
    )

  }
```

To go over the function above step by step:

1. We are passing in our array of options (buckets)
2. Get a number between 0 and 1. 
3. Get the percentage of each buckets (2 would be 50% each)
4. Loop through the bucket and see if the number falls within the range and return the bucket. 

### Creating our `getABTestResult`

Now we have a way to get a bucket, we need to return the URL and the bucket the user is in for when we use Next.js Middleware to power our A/B testing.

First we need import the `getBucket` code we just wrote, the `index.json` that holds our A/B Tests and the types from our Tina schema.

```ts
import { getBucket } from './getBucket'
import abTestDB from '../../content/ab-tests/index.json'
import { AbtestTests } from '.tina/__generated__/types'
```

Our `getABTestResult` function is going to take two parameters *`matchingABTest` and `bucketCookie`.* The `bucketCookie` is optional as a user may not have a cookie at the time of the requests. 

```ts
import { getBucket } from './getBucket'
import abTestDB from '../../content/ab-tests/index.json'
import { AbtestTests } from '.tina/__generated__/types'

export const getABTestResult = (
  matchingABTest: AbtestTests,
  bucketCookie?: string
) => {}
```

We now need to use our getBucket function but only if the `bucketCookie` is not passed to the function. 

```ts
import { getBucket } from './getBucket'
import abTestDB from '../../content/ab-tests/index.json'
import { AbtestTests } from '.tina/__generated__/types'

export const getABTestResult = (
  matchingABTest: AbtestTests,
  bucketCookie?: string
) => {
  const bucket =
    bucketCookie ||
    getBucket([
      matchingABTest.testId,
      ...matchingABTest.variants.map(t => t.testId),
    ])
}
```

We have most of the code now, we just need to check if the `matchingABTest` exists in our database, and if it does we should return the URL and bucket, otherwise it’s invalid or the default URL. 

```ts
export const getABTestResult = (
  matchingABTest: AbtestTests,
  bucketCookie?: string
) => {
  const bucket =
    bucketCookie ||
    getBucket([
      matchingABTest.testId,
      ...matchingABTest.variants.map(t => t.testId),
    ])

  const matchingVariant = matchingABTest.variants.find(t => t.testId == bucket)
  if (matchingVariant) {
    return {
      url: matchingVariant.href,
      bucket,
    }
  } else {
    //invalid bucket, or we're matched with the default AB test
    return {
      url: matchingABTest.href,
      bucket: matchingABTest.testId,
    }
  }
}
```

The final piece to our functionality code is adding the ability to `getExperiment` based on the pathname. This is a simple function we will also use in the Middleware

```ts
export const getExperiment = (pathname: string) =>
  abTestDB.tests.find(test => test.href == pathname)
```

Our `index.ts` file is now complete and we can move on to creating the Middleware that will issue the cookie, and provide the correct path based upon the A/B test. Below is the full `index.ts` file.

```ts
import { getBucket } from './getBucket'
import abTestDB from '../../content/ab-tests/index.json'
import { AbtestTests } from '.tina/__generated__/types'

export const getABTestResult = (
  matchingABTest: AbtestTests,
  bucketCookie?: string
) => {
  const bucket =
    bucketCookie ||
    getBucket([
      matchingABTest.testId,
      ...matchingABTest.variants.map(t => t.testId),
    ])

  const matchingVariant = matchingABTest.variants.find(t => t.testId == bucket)
  if (matchingVariant) {
    return {
      url: matchingVariant.href,
      bucket,
    }
  } else {
    //invalid bucket, or we're matched with the default AB test
    return {
      url: matchingABTest.href,
      bucket: matchingABTest.testId,
    }
  }
}

export const getExperiment = (pathname: string) =>
  abTestDB.tests.find(test => test.href == pathname)
```

## Middleware

Next.js Middleware allows you to use code over configuration, we need to check if there is an experiment for the URL, and then return the correct URL for the user and finally add a cookie if the user doesn’t have one. 

Create the `_middleware.ts` file in the `pages` folder, then we need to import `getExperiment` and `getABTestResult` and then the `NextResponse` and `NextRequest` from Next.js 

```ts
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server'
import { getExperiment, getABTestResult } from '../utils/ab-test'
```

A middleware functionality uses a `req` as a prop so our function will look like: 

```ts
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server'
import { getExperiment, getABTestResult } from '../utils/ab-test'

// Check for AB tests on a given page
export function middleware(req: NextRequest) {}
```

We can now use a built in clone function to create a URL variable that we will use to check what we need to do for our visitor.

```ts
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server'
import { getExperiment, getABTestResult } from '../utils/ab-test'

// Check for AB tests on a given page
export function middleware(req: NextRequest) {
  const url = req.nextUrl.clone()
}
```

Next we need to use our `getExperiment` code to retrieve the experiments for the URL, and if there isn’t an experiment we can just stop and return the original response.

```ts
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server'
import { getExperiment, getABTestResult } from '../utils/ab-test'

// Check for AB tests on a given page
export function middleware(req: NextRequest) {
  const url = req.nextUrl.clone()

  const matchingABTest = getExperiment(url.pathname)

  if (!matchingABTest) {
    return NextResponse.next()
  }
```

We now need to create a variable for our cookie name, so we can use the `testId` 

```ts

  const COOKIE_NAME = `bucket-${matchingABTest.testId}`
```

Then we can use our abTestResult using the cookie (if available) and the `matchingABTest` variable. 

```ts

  const COOKIE_NAME = `bucket-${matchingABTest.testId}`

  const abTestResult = getABTestResult(matchingABTest, req.cookies[COOKIE_NAME])
```

We can then set the `url.pathname` to the result of the `abTestResult` 

```ts

  const abTestResult = getABTestResult(matchingABTest, req.cookies[COOKIE_NAME])
  url.pathname = abTestResult.url
```

Then set the response to the URL using the `NextResponse.rewrite` function. 

```ts

  const res = NextResponse.rewrite(url)
```

Finally we want to add the cookie to the users browser so they will be served the correct experiment if they return to the site and then return the response. Below is the final result.

```ts
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server'
import { getExperiment, getABTestResult } from '../utils/ab-test'

// Check for AB tests on a given page
export function middleware(req: NextRequest) {
  const url = req.nextUrl.clone()

  const matchingABTest = getExperiment(url.pathname)

  if (!matchingABTest) {
    return NextResponse.next()
  }

  const COOKIE_NAME = `bucket-${matchingABTest.testId}`

  const abTestResult = getABTestResult(matchingABTest, req.cookies[COOKIE_NAME])
  url.pathname = abTestResult.url
  const res = NextResponse.rewrite(url)

  // Add the bucket to cookies if it's not there
  if (!req.cookies[COOKIE_NAME]) {
    res.cookie(COOKIE_NAME, abTestResult.bucket)
  }

  return res
}
```

The A/B experiment is now ready to use and you can test it by running it locally, you have a 50% chance of landing on `home-b` so you may need to delete your cookie each time.
