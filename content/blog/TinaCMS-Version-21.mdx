We are excited to announce the release of `tinacms@2.1.0` and `@tinacms/cli@1.5.51`!

### What's New:

1. **Removed Deprecated Hook**
   * A deprecated hook, which was part of legacy internal systems, has now been fully removed. This change does not affect the commonly used `useTina` hook.
2. **Next.js Version Upgrade**
   * We've upgraded the Next.js version in TinaCMS packages from 12 to 14, along with several other dependency updates to ensure compatibility and improved performance.
3. **PNPM Support for `create-tina-app`**
   * You can now use PNPM as an option when creating a Tina app, offering more flexibility and efficiency in your package management.
4. **React 18.3.1 Integration**
   * TinaCMS has been upgraded to use React 18.3.1, bringing you the latest features and improvements from React.
5. **New `toolbarOverride` Option for Rich Text Fields**
   * A new `toolbarOverride` option has been added to rich text fields, giving you greater control over your editor toolbar configurations. Checkout the [docs](/docs/reference/types/rich-text/) for more info

### Toolbar Override

Change what you want to display and the order it is displayed in the editor

```ts
{
  label: "Body",
  name: "body",
  isBody: true,
  type: "rich-text",
  toolbarOverride: ["heading", "bold", "italic"],
}
```

6. **Enhanced Media Uploads with Cloudinary Support**
   * The default media upload types now include support for Cloudinary files, allowing you to upload videos and other media directly through the media manager.
