We are excited to announce the release of `tinacms@2.1.0` and `@tinacms/cli@1.5.51`! ðŸš€

### What's New:

1. **API - Removed Deprecated Hook**
   A deprecated hook, which was part of legacy internal systems, has now been fully removed. This change does not affect the commonly used `useTina` hook.
2. **React Framework - Next.js Version Upgrade**
   We've upgraded the Next.js version in TinaCMS packages from 12 to 14, along with several other dependency updates to ensure compatibility and improved performance.
3. **Package Manager - pnpm Support for `create-tina-app`**
   You can now use pnpm as an option when creating a Tina app, offering more choices with package managers when starting a new project.
4. **React 18 Integration**
   TinaCMS has been upgraded to use React 18.3.1, bringing you the latest features and improvements from React.
5. **Markdown Editor - New `toolbarOverride` Option for Rich Text Fields**
   A new `toolbarOverride` option has been added to rich text fields, giving you greater control over your editor toolbar configurations. Check out the [docs](/docs/reference/types/rich-text/) for more info.
