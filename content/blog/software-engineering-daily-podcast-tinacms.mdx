Recently, our founders, Scott Gallant and Jordan Patterson, along with Lead Tina Developer, Nolan Phillips, sat down with the folks from the [Software Engineering Daily Podcast](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/) to talk about the CMS space.

> "With WordPress, you're building your website on top of WordPress. With Tina, **youâ€™re building the CMS into your website**.
>
> We provide a set of tools that make it easy for you to build those editing interfaces directly into your website so that it's not really a separate application. Your website itself becomes a content management system."

They cover the history of CMSs and where Tina fits into this landscape. They dive deeper into what Tina is, how it works, and what makes it 'Not a CMS'.
