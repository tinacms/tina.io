Next.js is a framework built on top of React for developing web applications. In detail, **Next.js has become one of the most popular choices when it comes to web development** thanks to its bootstrapped React environment (similar to `create-react-app`) and its simple, file-based routing logic.

**Next.js is simple and flexible**. Here you'll see how to use Next.js to build a simple Markdown-based blog.

Follow this step-by-step tutorial, and learn **how to implement the following Markdown blog in Next.js**:

Now, let's learn how to implement this Next.js blog based on Markdown.

## Clone the Starter Project

First, let's **clone the starter project**. That's nothing more than a boilerplate blog app to use as a starting point for this tutorial. Check it out on [GitHub](https://github.com/tinalabs/nextjs-starter-boilerplate) for reference, or clone the starter repository in the `my-nextjs-blog` directory with:

```
git clone https://github.com/tinalabs/nextjs-starter-boilerplate my-nextjs-blog
```

Then, enter the project folder, install the project dependencies, and launch the blog app with the following commands

```
cd my-nextjs-blog
npm install
npm run dev
```

After cloning the project and starting the [Next.js dev server](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/cli#development), navigate to `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser and you should be able to see the following page:

![The starter project in action](https://res.cloudinary.com/forestry-demo/image/upload/v1673425637/hm8AJj0t_hi0mer.png "The starter project in action")

As you can see, the blog app is pretty simple at the moment. Let's now dig into the structure of this starter project to **learn how to turn this app into a real Markdown-based blog**.

## Project Structure

If you take look at the starter project in your IDE, you'll see the following file structure:

```
my-nextjs-blog
├── components/
├── data/
├── pages/
├── public/
└── styles/
```

Note that `pages`, `public`, and `styles` come from the [Create Next App](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/create-next-app) initialization command. The other two directories were added to the project. Specifically, **`data` contains the blog configuration and other data, while `components` stores all React components required by the blog**.

Now, let's look at the `pages/index.js` file:

```javascript
// pages/index.js

const Index = props => {
  return (
    <Layout
      pathname="/"
      siteTitle={props.title}
      siteDescription={props.description}
    >
      <section>
        <BlogList />
      </section>
    </Layout>
  )
}

export default Index

export async function getStaticProps() {
  const configData = await import(`../data/config.json`)

  return {
    props: {
      title: configData.title,
      description: configData.description,
    },
  }
}
```

This file contains the home page component. Specifically, it returns a `Layout` component wrapping a `<section>` HTML element containing a `BlogList` component.

These are all the pieces that render our little starter app so far.

This is what `BlogList` looks like:

```javascript
// components/BlogList.js

import styles from "../styles/BlogList.module.css"

const BlogList = ({ allBlogs }) => {
  return (
    <div className={styles.bloglist__container}>
      <h3>List of all blog posts will go here</h3>
    </div>
  )
}

export default BlogList
```

As you can see, it accepts a `allBlogs` prop value. This should **contain the list of all blog posts to show on the home page of the blog**. You'll learn how to populate this prop later in this tutorial.

## Layout and Styling

**Each blog page has a common layout**. This is defined in the `Layout` component below:

```javascript
// components/Layout.js

import Header from "./Header"
import Meta from "./Meta"
import styles from "../styles/Layout.module.css"

export default function Layout(props) {
  return (
    <section
      className={styles.layout}
    >
      <Meta
        siteTitle={props.siteTitle}
        siteDescription={props.siteDescription}
      />
      <Header siteTitle={props.siteTitle} />
      <div className={styles.content}>{props.children}</div>
    </section>
  )
}
```

In detail, **the purpose of the `Layout` component is to provide the visual skeleton for every page of the site**. Typically, such a component contains a nav and/or header that appears on most or all pages, along with a footer element.

In this case, `Layout` only contains a header component that shows the site title. Keep in mind that **the use of a `Layout` component isn't unique to Next.js, and Gatsby websites also rely on a similar approach**.

Note that `Layout` contains also the following Meta component:

```javascript
// components/Meta.js

import Head from "next/head"

export default function Meta(props) {
  return (
    <Head>
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
      <meta charSet="utf-8" />
      <title>{props.siteTitle}</title>
      <meta name="Description" content={props.description}></meta>
    </Head>
  )
}
```

This uses the **Next.js [`Head`](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/head) component that enables you to specify what to put in the head section of your page for SEO** or accessibility purposes.

An important aspect to mention is that the `Layout` component uses component-level CSS. Don't forget that **Next.js works out of the box with [component-level CSS](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support#adding-component-level-css)**. That's super intuitive to use. All of the styles are scoped to the component. This means you don't have to worry about accidentally overriding a style rule somewhere else.

The global style of the blog app is handled in the `globals.css` you can find in the styles directory. So, if you want to change or add some global CSS rules, you can do it there. At the same time, **keep in mind that the global font isn't defined in the `global.css` file**. This is defined in the Next.js `_app.js` file below:

```javascript
// pages/_app.js

import "../styles/globals.css"
import { Work_Sans } from "@next/font/google"

// importing the Work Sans font with
// the Next.js 13 Font Optimization Feature
const workSans = Work_Sans({
  weight: ['400', '700'],
  style: ['normal', 'italic'],
  subsets: ['latin'],
})

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return <main className={workSans.className}>
    <Component {...pageProps} />
  </main>
}

export default MyApp
```

## Add the Posts Directory to the Project

Now that you're familiar with the structure of the project and Next.js fundamentals, let's **add everything required to make the Markdown blog in Next.js work**.

First, create a new directory called `posts` in the root folder of your project. This folder will contain all your Markdown blog posts. If you don't already have content ready, just add a few dummy blog posts. Consider using **[Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)** for sample photos, while **[Cupcake](http://www.cupcakeipsum.com/)**, **[Hipsum](https://hipsum.co/)**, or **[Sagan Ipsum](http://saganipsum.com/)** can help you generate text for your posts.

### Create a Sample Post

Now that you have a `posts` folder, it's time to **fill it with some Markdown posts**.

Here's an example of filler content for `/posts/my-post.md` with commonly used frontmatter values.

```markdown
---
  title: A trip to Iceland
author: 'Watson & Crick '
date: '2019-07-10T16:04:44.000Z'
hero_image: /norris-niman-iceland.jpg
---
  Brain is the seed of intelligence something incredible is waiting to be known.
```

If you aren't familiar with this concept, **a frontmatter is a way to store metadata in Markdown files**. Typically, **frontmatter metadata is stored in [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) format** in a block wrapped by three dashes placed at the beginning of a Markdown file.

Also, **place the images referenced in the `.md` files in the public directory**. In Next.js, you can access any file inside public from the base URL `/`. Learn more about [static file serving in Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/static-file-serving).

## Processing Markdown Files in Next.js

Now, it is time to install a few packages. These will help you process your Markdown files.

```
npm add raw-loader gray-matter react-markdown
```

Specifically:

* **[Raw Loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/raw-loader)** will process your Markdown files.
* **[Gray Matter](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/gray-matter)** will parse your YAML frontmatter values.
* **[React Markdown](https://github.com/rexxars/react-markdown)** will parse and render the body of your Markdown files.

### Add a `next.config.js` File to Configure Next.js

Now that you installed some packages needed to handle Markdown, you need to configure the use of the `raw-loader`. First, **create a [`next.config.js`](https://nextjs.org/docs#custom-configuration) file** at the root of the project.

This file enables you to **handle any custom configuration for Webpack, routing, build and runtime config, export options, and more**. In this use case, you simply have to [add a Webpack rule to make it use `raw-loader`](https://v4.webpack.js.org/loaders/raw-loader/) to process Markdown `.md` files.

```javascript
// next.config.js

module.exports = {
  webpack: function (config) {
    config.module.rules.push({
      test: /\.md$/,
      use: 'raw-loader',
    })
    return config
  },
}
```

Webpack is now able to deal with Markdown files. You now need to **configure Next.js to create a web page for each Markdown blog post file**. Let's learn how.

## Configure Dynamic Routing in Next.js

For some background knowledge, the `pages` directory is special in Next.js. Each `.js` file in this directory will respond to a matching HTTP request. For example, when the home page `"/"` is requested, the component exported from `pages/index.js` will be rendered. So, if you want your site to have a page at `/about`, simply create a file named `pages/about.js`.

This is awesome for static pages, but you want to have a single template from which all blog posts will be built, sourcing the different data from each Markdown file. This means you need to implement **dynamic routing**. In detail, **you want each blog post to have a good-looking URL associated with a page based on this template**.

This can be achieved in Next.js very easily. In detail, **[dynamic routes](https://nextjs.org/docs#dynamic-routing) in Next.js are identified by square brackets `[]` in the filename**. Within these brackets, you can pass a query parameter to the page component.

### Initialize the Blog Post Dynamic Content Page

Let's create a new folder in pages called blog, then add a new file within that blog folder `[slug].js`.

You'll learn how to complete this file soon. As for now, you need to know that **this file represents a dynamic web page**.

In other words, **the content of `pages/blog/[slug].js` will change based on the `[slug]` parameter in the URL**. In detail, based on the slug string extracted from the URL, `[slug].js` will read a Markdown file from the file system and use its data to render the blog post.

## Create the `pages/blog/[slug].js` Page Component

Let's code the `BlogTemplate` blog page component that will render the content contained in a Markdown file read from posts. Thanks to this page, most of the blog logic will be implemented.

In the `[slug].js` page component stored inside the blog directory, **you'll be able to access whatever string passed in the URL through the `slug` parameter**. Typically, such info is used to dynamically retrieve the data to render the page. For example, if you visit `http://localhost:3000/blog/julius-caesar`, the slug query parameter in `[slug].js` will contain the `"julius-caesar"` string.

Let's now learn how to use the slug parameter to retrieve your content data.

### Get the Markdown Data for the Blog Page Component

With dynamic routing, you can **make use of the `slug` parameter**. Specifically, you can use `slug` to get the data from the corresponding Markdown file in `getStaticProps()` as follows:

```javascript
// pages/blog/[slug].js

import Image from "next/image"
import matter from "gray-matter"
import ReactMarkdown from "react-markdown"
import styles from "../../styles/Blog.module.css"
import glob from "glob"
import Layout from "../../components/Layout"

function reformatDate(fullDate) {
  const date = new Date(fullDate)
  return date.toDateString().slice(4)
}

export default function BlogTemplate({ frontmatter, markdownBody, siteTitle }) {
  return (
    <Layout siteTitle={siteTitle}>
      <article className={styles.blog}>
        <figure className={styles.blog__hero}>
          <Image
            width="1920"
            height="1080"
            src={frontmatter.hero_image}
            alt={`blog_hero_${frontmatter.title}`}
          />
        </figure>
        <div className={styles.blog__info}>
          <h1>{frontmatter.title}</h1>
          <h3>{reformatDate(frontmatter.date)}</h3>
        </div>
        <div className={styles.blog__body}>
          <ReactMarkdown>{markdownBody}</ReactMarkdown>
        </div>
        <h2 className={styles.blog__footer}>Written By: {frontmatter.author}</h2>
      </article>
    </Layout>
  )
}

export async function getStaticProps(context) {
  // extracting the slug from the context
  const { slug } = context.params

  const config = await import(`../../data/config.json`)

  // retrieving the Markdown file associated to the slug
  // and reading its data
  const content = await import(`../../posts/${slug}.md`)
  const data = matter(content.default)

  return {
    props: {
      siteTitle: config.title,
      frontmatter: data.data,
      markdownBody: data.content,
    },
  }
}

export async function getStaticPaths() {
  // getting all .md files from the posts directory
  const blogs = glob.sync(`posts/**/*.md`)

  // converting the file names to their slugs
  const blogSlugs = blogs.map(file =>
    file
      .split('/')[1]
      .replace(/ /g, '-')
      .slice(0, -3)
      .trim()
  )

  // creating a path for each of the `slug` parameter
  const paths = blogSlugs.map(slug => { return { params: { slug: slug } } })

  return {
    paths,
    fallback: false,
  }
}
```

> Note the use of `gray-matter` and `ReactMarkdown` to properly handle the YAML frontmatter and Markdown body, respectively.

An in-depth look at how this snippet works. Let's assume you navigate to the `http://localhost:3000/blog/julius-caesar` dynamic route. The `BlogTemplate` component in `pages/blog/[slug].js` is passed the params object `{ slug: "julius-caesar" }`.

When the `getStaticProps()` function is called, that `params` object is passed in through the [context parameter](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/data-fetching/get-server-side-props#context-parameter). Then, `slug` is extracted from the query params stored in `context`. In detail, **`slug` is used to search for a `.md` file within the posts directory that has the same file name**.

Once you get the data from that file, **you can parse the frontmatter from the Markdown body and return its data**. That data is passed down as props to the `BlogTemplate` component, which will render that data as it needs.

### Implementing `getStaticPaths()`

At this point, you should be more familiar with `getStaticProps()`. But the **[`getStatisPaths()`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/get-static-paths)** function may look new to you. Since this template uses dynamic routes, you need to define a list of paths for each blog. This way, **Next.js will be able to statically render each blog post past at build time**. Keep in mind that you need to use `getStaticPaths()` only when it comes to dynamic routing.

In the return object from `getStaticPaths()`, the following two keys are required:

* **[`paths`](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/data-fetching/get-static-paths#paths)**: Contains an array of object having a params field with the required dynamic param. For example, `{ params : { slug: "julius-caesar"} }`.
* **[`fallback`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/overview#the-fallback-key-required)**: Allows you to control the Next.js behavior when a path isn't returned from `getStaticPaths()`. Set it to false to make Next.js return a 404 page for unknown paths.

> Before the release of Next.js 9.3, this path generation for static export could be handled via [`exportPathMap`](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next.config.js/exportPathMap).

Now, navigate to [`http://localhost:3000/blog/my-post`](http://localhost:3000/blog/my-post). This is what the BlogTemplate component looks like:

![http://localhost:3000/blog/my-post in action](https://res.cloudinary.com/forestry-demo/image/upload/v1673426650/mArAHU8g_1_bedrfy.gif "http://localhost:3000/blog/my-post in action")

As you can see, it perfectly renders the blog post data stored in Markdown format.

## Add a Homepage to Your Blog

Let's finish this simple Markdown-based blog in Next.js by completing the home page.

All you have to do is **change the data retrieval logic in `pages/index.js` page**. Specifically, you want to pass the proper data to the `BlogList` component on the `Index` page. Since you can only use `getStaticProps()` on page components, you'll have to pass the blog data down from the `Index` component to `BlogList` as a prop.

Implement `pages/index.js` as follows:

```javascript
// pages/index.js

import matter from "gray-matter"
import Layout from "../components/Layout"
import BlogList from "../components/BlogList"

const Index = props => {
  return (
    <Layout
      pathname="/"
      siteTitle={props.title}
      siteDescription={props.description}
    >
      <section>
        <BlogList allBlogs={props.allBlogs} />
      </section>
    </Layout>
  )
}

export default Index

export async function getStaticProps() {
  // getting the website config
  const siteConfig = await import(`../data/config.json`)

  const webpackContext = require.context("../posts", true, /\.md$/)
  // the list of file names contained
  // inside the "posts" directory
  const keys = webpackContext.keys()
  const values = keys.map(webpackContext)

  // getting the post data from the files contained
  // in the "posts" folder
  const posts = keys.map((key, index) => {
    // dynamically creating the post slug
    // from file name
    const slug = key
      .replace(/^.*[\\\/]/, "")
      .split(".")
      .slice(0, -1)
      .join(".")

    // getting the .md file value associated
    // with the current file name
    const value = values[index]

    // parsing the YAML metadata and markdown body
    // contained in the .md file
    const document = matter(value.default)

    return {
      frontmatter: document.data,
      markdownBody: document.content,
      slug,
    }
  })

  return {
    props: {
      allBlogs: posts,
      title: siteConfig.default.title,
      description: siteConfig.default.description,
    },
  }
}
```

The `getStaticProps()` function here may be slightly complex to look at, but let's take it one step at a time. The logic here is based on the [`require.context()`](https://webpack.js.org/guides/dependency-management/#requirecontext) function provided by Webpack. This **allows you to create your own Webpack context** based on three parameters:

* The directory to match within.
* A boolean flag to include or exclude subdirectories.
* A regular expression to match files against.

You can define a Webpack context with `require.context()` with the following syntax:

```javascript
require.context(
  directory,
  (useSubdirectories = true),
  (regExp = /^\.\/.*$/),
)
```

Note that the parameters in round brackets are optional. For example, this is how you can call the `require.context()` function:

```javascript
require.context("../posts", true, /\\.md$/)
```

Thanks to a Webpack context, you can pick out all the files matching a regular expression from a particular directory. This allows you to **generate the slug string from each file name, read its content, parse it with the frontmatter library, and pass the manipulated data to Index as props**.

Then, the blog data is passed as a prop to the `BlogList` component. In the `BlogList` component, you can iterate over the blog data and render the list of post previews as you wish. Specifically, **the `BlogList` component takes care of rendering the blog data**.

This is what `BlogList` looks like:

```javascript
import Link from "next/link"
import ReactMarkdown from "react-markdown"
import styles from "../styles/BlogList.module.css"
import Image from "next/image"

function truncateSummary(content) {
  return content.slice(0, 200).trimEnd()
}

function reformatDate(fullDate) {
  const date = new Date(fullDate)
  return date.toDateString().slice(4)
}

const BlogList = ({ allBlogs }) => {
  return (
    <ul>
      {allBlogs && allBlogs.length > 1 &&
        allBlogs.map(post => (
          <li key={post.slug}>
            <Link href={{ pathname: `/blog/${post.slug}` }} className={styles.blog__link}>
              <div className={styles.hero_image}>
                <Image
                  width={384}
                  height={288}
                  src={post.frontmatter.hero_image}
                  alt={post.frontmatter.hero_image}
                />
              </div>
              <div className={styles.blog__info}>
                <h2>{post.frontmatter.title}</h2>
                <h3>{reformatDate(post.frontmatter.date)}</h3>
                <ReactMarkdown disallowedElements={["a"]}>{truncateSummary(post.markdownBody)}</ReactMarkdown>
              </div>
            </Link>
          </li>
        ))}
    </ul>
  )
}

export default BlogList
```

If your development server is running, you should now be able to navigate your Next.js Markdown blog app at `http://localhost:3000`. Otherwise, launch the app with:

```
npm run dev
```

Note that **you may have to relaunch the homepage of the blog to see the blog posts**.

## Conclusion and Next Steps

In this article, you learned how to build a Markdown-based blog app in Next.js from scratch. As you saw here, this doesn't require a lot of code. In detail, you can easily configure Next.js to read Markdown files from the file system. You can then use these files as a source for your blog posts.

After setting up your Markdown-based blog site, you'll most likely need a CMS ([Content Management System)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system) to make editing and updating your posts or data easier. Stay tuned for **the next blog on setting up this starter with TinaCMS**.
