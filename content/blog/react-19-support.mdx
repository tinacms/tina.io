With the latest release of `tinacms@2.7.7` and `@tinacms/cli@1.9.7`, TinaCMS now offers **full, production-ready support for React 19**. You can upgrade your projects to React 19 straight away—no blockers, no workarounds, and no waiting.

## Why React 19 Support Matters

React 19 brings breaking changes and new APIs that many teams want to adopt for better performance, maintainability, and access to the latest features. In the past, CMS dependencies have often held back React upgrades. With this release, TinaCMS is no longer a roadblock. You are free to move to React 19 when it suits your project.

## What Does This Mean for You?

- **No breaking changes for React projects.**  
  If your project already works with TinaCMS and uses React, upgrading to React 19 is as simple as updating your dependencies.
- **Non-React frameworks require new dependencies.**  
  If you use TinaCMS with a non-React framework (for example, Hugo or Eleventy), you must now add `react` and `react-dom` as dependencies. This is required for TinaCMS to function, even if your site itself is not built with React.
- **No new APIs to learn.**  
  The upgrade is seamless. Your existing TinaCMS setup will continue to work as expected.
- **No migration steps.**  
  You do not need to change any code or configuration.

## Upgrade Path

To upgrade, just update your dependencies:

```bash
npm install tinacms@latest @tinacms/cli@latest
# or
yarn add tinacms@latest @tinacms/cli@latest
```

TinaCMS now supports `react` and `react-dom` versions `>=18.3.1 <20.0.0`.  
You can run TinaCMS on either React 18 or 19, but we recommend React 19 for the best results.

## Using TinaCMS with Non-React Frameworks

If you are using TinaCMS with a non-React framework (for example, Hugo or Eleventy), you **must** add `react` and `react-dom` as dependencies in your project. TinaCMS requires these packages to function, even if your site itself is not built with React. Install them with:

```bash
npm install react@^19 react-dom@^19
# or
yarn add react@^19 react-dom@^19
```

If you omit these dependencies, TinaCMS will fail to load.

## Technical Details

- **Peer dependencies** for `react` and `react-dom` have been updated to allow React 19. This now means Tina will use your version of React over its internal version.
- **Internal dependencies** and build tooling have been updated for compatibility and performance.
- **Linting and code quality:** All known issues, including hook violations, have been resolved.

## Stability and Support

This release has been tested across a range of real-world projects and scenarios.  
If you do run into an edge case or unexpected behaviour, [open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/tinacms/tinacms/issues/new?template=bug-report.yml) with clear reproduction steps. We are committed to a quick turnaround on any problems.

## Looking Forward

We’re committed to keeping TinaCMS compatible with the latest React versions and removing upgrade friction wherever possible.

Best,
