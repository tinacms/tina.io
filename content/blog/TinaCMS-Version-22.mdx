We are excited to announce the release of `tinacms@2.2.0` and `@tinacms/cli@1.6.0`! 🚀

Finding your media is now easier than ever with infinite scroll in the Media Manager, and you can quickly locate files with the new file path display in collection items. Plus, enhance your content creation with the upgraded Platejs version 36. Explore these updates and more on our new “What’s New” page!

### What's New:

1. **Platejs Version Upgrade!**
   * One of the significant updates in this release is the upgrade of Platejs from plate-headless to Platejs version 36. This upgrade lays the groundwork for integrating popular plugins that will empower content creators even further. We encourage you to explore the latest plugins on [Platejs](https://platejs.org/docs#plugins "Platejs") and join the discussion about which ones you’d like to see added to TinaCMS.![](https://res.cloudinary.com/forestry-demo/image/upload/v1724047007/blog-media/2.2/SCR-20240819-nzej_ocb7rm.png)
2. **Infinite Scroll for the Media Manager**
   * Managing media files just got easier with the introduction of infinite scroll in the Media Manager. No more clicking through pages or manually loading more files—now, as you scroll through your media library, new items load automatically, allowing you to browse through your entire collection effortlessly. This is just the beginning of our ongoing efforts to enhance the Media Manager, with many more improvements on the way!
3. **File Path Added to Collection Items**
   * Ever wondered where that post or page is actually stored? We did too! That’s why we’ve added the file path display for collection items.![](https://res.cloudinary.com/forestry-demo/image/upload/v1724049604/blog-media/2.2/SCR-20240819-oqta_tmkdjj.png)
