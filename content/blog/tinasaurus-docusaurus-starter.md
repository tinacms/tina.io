We're excited to share [Tinasaurus](https://github.com/tinacms/tinasaurus ""), a Docusaurus starter site with support for TinaCMS.

[Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/ "") is powerful framework developed by [Meta](https://opensource.fb.com/ "") for building documentation sites.  Tina gives you a CMS interface for editing Markdown content that stays in-sync with your Git repository. Tina works great for teams who use the [docs-as-code](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/docs-as-code/ "") approach and need a CMS UI for some of their content writers.

✅ Integrates with existing Git and CI/CD workflows\
