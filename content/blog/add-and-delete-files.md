[Creating](https://tinacms.org/blog/add-and-delete-files/#creating-new-files) and [deleting](https://tinacms.org/blog/add-and-delete-files/#deleting-files) content — two fundamental sides of the CMS coin. This article will cover how to set up this functionality with TinaCMS on a [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) site. But first, some overview.

![tinacms-add-new-file-gif](/gif/add-new-blog.gif)

### Tina Overview — sidebar, forms, plugins

When you install Tina, you immediately get access to a **sidebar**. This sidebar is the main interface for editing and managing content with Tina

To make content editable on your site, you need to register a [form](https://tinacms.org/docs/plugins/forms) to Tina. Forms appear in the sidebar, displaying [fields](https://tinacms.org/docs/plugins/fields) where you can edit content on the page.

[Plugins](https://tinacms.org/docs/cms#plugins) extend the functionality of the core CMS. Behind the scenes, plugins do some big work with Tina. They register forms, create new screen views, and allow us to add new content. If you're interested to learn more, read this post on Tina's [dynamic plugin system](https://tinacms.org/blog/dynamic-plugin-system/).

## Creating New Files

### The Steps 🚶‍♀️

These steps will be our journey-map for setting up content-creation functionality in a [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) website.

1. [Set-up a `content-creator` plugin](https://tinacms.org/blog/add-and-delete-files#step-1-set-up-a-content-creator-plugin)
2. [Register the plugin with Tina](https://tinacms.org/blog/add-and-delete-files#2-register-the-plugin-with-the-sidebar)
3. [Customize the `create-form`](https://tinacms.org/blog/add-and-delete-files#3-customize-the-create-form)
4. [Configure default data for the new file](https://tinacms.org/blog/add-and-delete-files#4-configure-defaults)

### Where to add the plugin

Before we get into the steps, we need to zoom out to consider the editing process in our site. As a developer, you get to decide when editors can create new content.

To be more specific, **you can register the `content-creator` plugin on any component** in the site. When that component renders, editors will be able to create new content.

You may want create a new blog only when you're on the blog list page. To do this, you'll register the plugin on the list component.

If you always want to be able to create new blogs, you'll register the plugin on a component that is always rendered. Examples of this could be the `Layout` or `Root` component.

**Consider the experience before you dig into code.** One of the incredible things about Tina is that you have this finite control, so use it.

## Step 1: Set-up a content-creator plugin

Okay, let’s get into it. In this step we are going to create a `content-creator` plugin 👩‍🎨.

There are different plugins for creating new markdown or JSON files. In this tutorial, we'll use `RemarkCreatorPlugin` for markdown files. Feel free to read about the `JsonCreatorPlugin` in the [documentation](https://tinacms.org/guides/gatsby/git/create-new-files).

Head to the component file where you want to add this plugin. This example will use the `Layout` component. This way, **the ability to create new posts is always available to the editor.**

The example below shows how to create an instance of a `RemarkCreatorPlugin`. The basic information the plugin needs is a label, filename, and fields array.

```javascript
/*
 ** Layout.js
 */

/*
 ** 1. import RemarkCreatorPlugin to
 **    construct a `content-creator` plugin.
 */
import { RemarkCreatorPlugin } from 'gatsby-tinacms-remark'

/*
 ** 2. instantiate RemarkCreatorPlugin with
 **    label, filename, and fields.
 */
const CreatePostPlugin = new RemarkCreatorPlugin({
  /*
   ** LABEL: A simple action label displayed when editors
   ** interact with the + button in the sidebar.
   */
  label: 'New Blog Post',

  /*
   ** FILENAME: A function whose return value
   ** should be the path to the new file.
   */
  filename: form => {
    return form.filename
  },

  /*
   ** FIELDS: An array of field objects defining the shape
   ** of the form to fill out when creating a new file.
   */
  fields: [
    {
      name: 'filename',
      component: 'text',
      label: 'Filename',
      placeholder: 'content/blog/hello-world/index.md',
      description:
        'The full path to the new markdown file, relative to the repository root.',
    },
  ],
})
```

### Formatting the path to the new file

There are many ways you could set up the return value for the `filename`. A helpful pattern to use could be to hard-code the directory path, and then 'slugify' the title. You can do this manually with Regex or use a handy package aptly called [`slugify`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/slugify).

```javascript
const CreatePostPlugin = new RemarkCreatorPlugin({
  //...
  filename: form => {
    // 'form' holds the data inputted by the 'create-form'
    const slug = form.title.replace(/\s+/, '-').toLowerCase()

    return `content/blog/${slug}.md`
  },
})
```

Notice how data submitted by the `create-form` is being used. When a new file is created, you can have the editor enter a title, and then all the **`create-form` data is passed to the `filename` function**.

You can use the data from `create-form` to creatively generate new file paths or populate default data (more on that later). Overall, formatting the `filename` depends on the structure of your project. Pick a simple solution that makes sense to you or checkout more examples [here](/guides/git/configuration#formatting-the-filename--path).

## 2. Register the plugin with the sidebar

In the previous step, we created the plugin, now we actually need to add it to the sidebar (and cms).

If you haven't already, install the `tinacms` package.

```bash
$ yarn add tinacms || npm install tinacms
```

Then import `withPlugin` from `tinacms`. `withPlugin` is a [higher-order component](https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html) used for adding plugins to the CMS.

Export the component and plugin using `withPlugin` and you should now be able to add new posts from the Tina sidebar. The location of the new files will be based on the return value from the `filename` function.

```javascript
// 1. Import withPlugin
import { withPlugin } from 'tinacms'
import { RemarkCreatorPlugin } from 'gatsby-tinacms-remark'

function Layout(props) {
  return (
      /*
      ** Nothing gets changed in the actual component
      ** to register the `content-creator` plugin
      */
    )
  }

// 2. Create instance of `RemarkCreatorPlugin`
const CreateBlogPlugin = new RemarkCreatorPlugin( {
  label: 'Add New Blog',
  filename: form => {
    const slug = form.title.replace(/\s+/g, '-').toLowerCase()
    return `content/posts/${slug}.md`
  },
  fields: [
    {
      label: 'Title',
      name: 'title',
      component: 'text',
      required: true
    },
  ],
})

// 3. Export the component & `content-creator` plugin
export default withPlugin(Layout, CreateBlogPlugin)
```

Start up your development server (`gatsby develop`) and you should see a blue plus (+) icon in the top menu of the sidebar. Click it and you’ll see the `label` you set in your plugin configuration. Try to create a new file! See what happens.

> **Troubleshooting Tip:** If you don't see the icon, check if the component where you added the plugin is actively rendered.

## 3. Customize The Create Form

![tinacms-create-content-form](/img/content-creator-ex.jpg)

In our initial example, the `create-form` only captured a title. We can add more fields to capture data that will populate the new file, such as the date and author.

```javascript
const CreatePostPlugin = new RemarkCreatorPlugin({
  label: 'Create Post',
  fields: [
    {
      name: 'title',
      component: 'text',
      label: 'Title',
      description: 'The title of your new post',
      required: true
    },
    {
     name: 'date',
     component: 'date',
     label: 'Date',
     description: 'The default will be today'
   },
   {
     name: 'author',
     component: 'text'
     label: 'Author',
     description: 'Who wrote this?',
   }
  ],
  filename: form => {
    const slug = form.title.replace(/\s+/, '-').toLowerCase()
    return `content/blog/${slug}.md`
  },
})

```

Notice the use of a `required` property on the `title` field. Use this to ensure you get all the required data necessary for creating the new file.

Learn about the default [fields](https://tinacms.org/docs/plugins/fields).

## 4. Configure Defaults

`RemarkCreatorPlugin` can take additional information to populate default data into newly created files. For markdown, we can add default frontmatter values and a markdown body — see the example below.

```javascript
const CreateBlogButton = new RemarkCreatorPlugin( {
 label: 'Add New Post',

 filename: form => {
     const slug = form.title.replace(/\s+/g, '-').toLowerCase()
     return `content/posts/${slug}.md`
 },

 fields: [
   {
     label: 'Title',
     name: 'title',
     component: 'text',
     required: true
   },
   {
     label: 'Date',
     name: 'date',
     component: 'date',
     description: 'The default will be today'
   },
   {
     label: 'Author',
     description: 'Who wrote this, yo?',
     name: 'author',
     component: 'text'
   }
 ],

 /*
 ** 1. Add default frontmatter with data inputted
 **    through fields in the `create-form`
 */
 frontmatter: postInfo => ({
   title: postInfo.title,
   date: postInfo.date ? postInfo.date : new Date(),
   author: postInfo.author ? postInfo.author: ‘Kurt Vonnegut’
 }),

 // 2. Add a default markdown body
 body: postInfo => `New post, who dis?`
})
```

Both the frontmatter and body functions receive the data captured by fields in the `create-form`. Use the inputted values to populate the new file, or setup defaults if nothing was entered.

## Deleting Files

With the power to create, comes the power to delete 🧙‍♀️. I promise you this step is much simpler.

Instead of adding a ‘delete’ plugin, we simply need to pass a `delete-action` to the main form options.
Head to a file where you have a Tina form configured in your project. This will typically be a template file that generates multiple posts, casestudies, etc. If you don’t have a Tina form configured in your project, learn more about creating forms with Gatsby+Tina [here](https://tinacms.org/guides/gatsby/adding-tina/project-setup).

You don't want to give the editors the power to delete files that they shouldn't. So think about where you want this action to be available. For something like a blog, it makes sense to add the `delete-action` to a blog template form. But it might not make sense to add the `delete-action` to a form that edits global site configuration, for example.

Below is an example blog template with the `delete-action` added:

```javascript
// 1. Import `DeleteAction`
import { remarkForm, DeleteAction } from 'gatsby-tinacms-remark'

function BlogTemplate(props) {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>{props.markdownRemark.frontmatter.title}</h1>
      <p>{props.markdownRemark.frontmatter.description}</p>
    </>
  )
}

// 2. Add the `DeleteAction` to the form
let BlogFormOptions = {
  actions: [DeleteAction],
  fields: [
    {
      label: 'Title',
      name: 'frontmatter.title',
      description: 'Enter the title of the post here',
      component: 'text',
    },
    {
      label: 'Description',
      name: 'frontmatter.description',
      description: 'Enter the post description',
      component: 'textarea',
    },
  ],
}

export default remarkForm(BlogTemplate, BlogForm)
```

You can import the `DeleteAction` from `gatsby-tinacms-remark` or `gatsby-tinacms-json`, depending on your filetype. Then on your form options definition, add the action and that’s it!

You can now access this `delete-action` via the three-dot icon near the save button. Test it out! But make sure you don't delete a file that you need or can easily restore it if you do 🧞‍♂️.

## Happy Creating (and Deleting)! 👩‍🎤
