I’m excited to share that Tina has been acquired by [SSW](https://ssw.com.au/), an Australian software development company and long-time Tina customer. There will be no disruptions to our service and no action will be required by any of our users.

Before the acquisition we were operating on a tight budget and a skeleton crew of just four developers. We were struggling to keep up with the needs of our customers and community.  Now, we have the resources to bring Tina to the next level.

SSW’s founder, Adam Cogan, is a big believer in our approach to content management.  His company has been using TinaCMS on their site, [SSW.com.au](https://ssw.com.au/), since the early days of Tina.  When he was interested in purchasing Tina, I asked him why and his answer stuck with me. He said, **“I just want the project to live forever”**. After spending more time with Adam and his team, it became obvious that they care deeply about open-source software and they are very aligned with our long-term vision of building a world-class CMS that supports Git. 

SSW has been operating for over 30 years and has over 100 employees in 4 countries. They bring a ton of experience and resources to our small team. Now that we’re a part of SSW we’re starting to increase Tina's team size and accelerate its development. This acquisition provides Tina with a stable foundation and resources to become a leading CMS. 

I’m going from CEO to Product Owner. That means I’m going to spend 100% of my time making sure the product becomes amazing. Now that we’re increasing our development capacity, I’d love to hear what you’d like to see improved with Tina. If you have product suggestions or bugs please post in GitHub, for support check out our community Discord, and to say “hello” - you can send an email to Adam and me ([adamcogan@tina.io](mailto\:adamcogan@tina.io) and [scott@tina.io](mailto\:scott@tina.io)). 

Thank you to everyone in the TinaCMS community who has supported us over the years. 

I’m looking forward to our next chapter!
