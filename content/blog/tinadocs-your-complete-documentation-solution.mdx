Over the past few months we've been building a new documentation starter template designed to make it easier for teams to create, edit and maintain docs using TinaCMS. This project is now publicly available as [TinaDocs,](https://tina.io/tinadocs) a starter package designed to specifically target a fully-structured documentation setup built on Next.js and TinaCMS.

To try it out without installing it - try the [online demo sandbox](https://docsdemo.tina.io/admin/index.html#/~/docs)!

## Why Documentation Matters

Markdown has long been the standard format for technical docs. Because of this, documentation has naturally become one of the strongest and most common use cases for TinaCMS. Tina's editing model was built to leverage the simplicity of Markdown. Over time, we saw many teams building their own documentation setups on top of TinaCMS, each having their own build specific to their needs.

While this flexibility is powerful, it also meant teams were reinventing the wheel, building similar components, navigation systems, and workflows from scratch. We recognized an opportunity to bring all of this together into a cohesive, battle-tested starter that teams could customize to their exact needs.

## Introducing TinaDocs

TinaDocs brings together years of documentation best practices with personal customizability and a rich feature set. It's built for both developers and non-developers, making it easy for your entire team to contribute to documentation without touching code.

### What Makes TinaDocs Special

**No Proprietary Data Store** - Your content lives entirely in your GitHub repository - versioned, portable, and fully under your control. No vendor lock-in, no database dependencies

**Built on Next.js** - Leverage the performance and developer experience of Next.js, with server-side rendering, static site generation, and optimized builds out of the box

**TinaCMS Integration** - Seamlessly edit content through TinaCMS's intuitive visual editor, or work directly with Markdown files. Your team can choose the workflow that works best for them

## Rich Feature Set

TinaDocs comes packed with everything you need to build world-class documentation:

* **Fast Search powered by PageFind** - Lightning-fast, client-side search that works offline and doesn't require a backend. Your users can find what they need instantly
* **API documentation generated from OpenAPI specs** - Keep your [API docs ](https://tina.io/tinadocs/docs/tinadocs-features/openapi-spec-docs)in sync with your code. Simply point TinaDocs to your OpenAPI specification, and it automatically generates beautiful, interactive API documentation with request/response schemas and example code
* **A multi-tabbed interface for complex documentation layouts** - Organize complex information with tabbed interfaces, perfect for code examples across multiple languages, different implementation approaches, or step-by-step tutorials
* **Custom theming to match your brand** - [Six carefully crafted themes](https://tina.io/tinadocs/docs/tinadocs-features/styling) come out of the box, and the theming system makes it easy to customize colors, typography, and styles to perfectly match your brand identity
* **A plethora of standardized documentation components** - From code blocks with syntax highlighting to callouts, accordions, card grids, and more. Every component you need to create engaging, easy-to-read documentation is included. Find the full list on the [documentation for TinaDocs](https://tina.io/tinadocs/docs/tinadocs-features/feature-list)
* **SEO optimization** - [Built-in SEO features](https://tina.io/tinadocs/docs/tinadocs-features/search-engine-optimization-seo) ensure your documentation ranks well in search engines. Meta tags, structured data, and sitemap generation are all handled automatically
