Today we are excited to release `tinacms@1.5.1` and `@tinacms/clil@1.5.8`. The full list of changes can be found [in the changeset PR](https://github.com/tinacms/tinacms/pull/3819 "changesets PR").

## Directories in Document List

The Document List view for a collection will now nest documents within directories, instead of listing all documents as a flat list at the root.

## Duplicating Documents

In the document list, editors now have the ability to duplicate a document.

## Support for collections at the root

Tina now allows collections to be configured at the root, by setting path: '/' on a collection. This is common for sites migrating from Forestry, which want to allow editing on their root-level config files.

## Commit messages show author name

When your users save in Tina, the commit message now includes the author's name (or email).
