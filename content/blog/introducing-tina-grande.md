{{ WarningCallout text="**Update:** The examples in this post reference an outdated Gatsby implementation. We recommend using [Next.js](/docs/integrations/nextjs/) for a solution with less friction."}}

[Tina Grande](https://github.com/tinacms/tina-starter-grande 'Tina Grande Repo') is a Gatsby starter with built-in TinaCMS integration. _Grande_ was built to provide a reference implementation of Tina that covers a variety of use cases. Even for those that don‚Äôt need a starter, we hope that Grande will prove to be a useful reference for both designers and developers looking to use TinaCMS.

## Breakdown

### üß± Content Structure

All site content is stored in the `/content` folder in the root of the project. Here you‚Äôll find images, pages, posts, and settings. **Posts** use markdown, while **Pages** and **Settings** use JSON. You‚Äôll notice there are `dummy.json` and `dummy.md` files; these are added to ensure that even if all site content is removed, the graphql queries will still work.

Gatsby pages are typically stored in `/pages`, which you won't find in _Grande_. Since all pages are dynamic, look to the `/content/pages` folder to see what pages will get generated.

### üé® Theme

_Grande_ features a fully customizable theme. You can edit the site colors, header styles, hero styles and more. Through the sidebar, select the **Theme** form to edit global theme settings. Note that **Hero** settings can be overridden by individual pages.

When you customize _Grande's_ colors, the theme will intelligently select a foreground color based on the theme colours chosen, which means you can choose any color without causing contrast issues. Some elements ‚Äî such as links ‚Äî select between the primary and secondary color based on which option provides better contrast. Updated colors will be reflected in the website as they're made, but the Tina UI _(and site meta colors)_ won't be updated until the Gatsby server is restarted.

Currently to customize the site logo you'll need to modify two files: `src/components/header.js` and `content/images/icon.png`. The header logo is a [styled-icon](https://styled-icons.js.org/) which allows for easy theming.

### üìÑ Pages

Pages use a blocks-based system that is extendible to add any block you‚Äôd like. At the time of writing you can choose from a **title**, **form** or _**content**_ block.

The **form** block is a simple form builder with **[Formspree.io ](https://formspree.io/ 'Formspree.io')** integration. You can select pre-made inputs or create a custom input. Each input has a **label**, **type** and **autocomplete** property. The first time your form is used from a new domain it requires confirmation, so send a test message and you'll receive a confirmation prompt from Formspree.

On the _page_ sidebar form you can select _hero_ to add a hero section to your page. If the hero contains a **headline**, **textline** or at least one **action** it will be rendered above your content. The default hero image is set through the theme but can be customized on a per-page (or post) basis. Toggle **large** to add extra vertical spacing to the hero section.

### üìù Posts

You can create posts from within Tina by using the _+_ button in the top right of the sidebar. Posts are created as a draft by default and won‚Äôt be published with your live site. You can edit the post in the sidebar, or use the in-page editor to write your blog post by clicking the _edit_ button on the top left of the post.
