We've rolled out some major updates to its Media Manager, making content handling faster and more user-friendly. Here’s what’s new:

1. Responsive Design: The Media Manager now adapts perfectly to any screen size, so you can manage files effortlessly whether you’re on desktop, tablet, or mobile.

1. Infinite Scroll: Say goodbye to paging! Media items now load dynamically as you scroll, giving you a smoother, more intuitive browsing experience.

1. Non-Image File Support: You can now upload and handle a variety of files beyond images, including PDFs, audio, and videos (MP4, MKV), all within the Media Manager.
2. Bug Fixes: We resolved an issue where the active item window stayed open after navigation. The UI is now cleaner and more responsive.

These updates make the Media Manager more powerful and flexible, improving your workflow on any device. Stay tuned for more improvements as we keep pushing TinaCMS forward!
