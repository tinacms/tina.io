We’ve had such great feedback from all of you in the herd about our last pricing update, so while we're on a roll we are excited to roll out a **new annual billing option** for TinaCMS users!

📅 What’s changing? Previously, TinaCMS only offered monthly subscriptions, but now you can switch to annual billing and enjoy more value for your money.

💰 What’s the deal? When you choose the annual plan, you **get 12 months of TinaCMS for the price of just 10**. That means you’re saving the cost of 2 full months — more time to build and less to worry about budget! 😍

If you’re ready to streamline your content management and save on costs, this new pricing plan is for you! 🙌

👉 **Check out the [Plans & Pricing](https://tina.io/pricing/) details and upgrade your plan today!**
