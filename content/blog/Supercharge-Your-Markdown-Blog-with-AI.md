## The Power of AI-driven Content Suggestions

AI has been a hot topic as of late, but its not always easy to get AI suggestions for your content that you can quickly accept or ignore. Right now, getting suggestions often  involves a lot of copy and pasting from chatGTP and then making piecemeal updates to your real content.  We where tired of this so we decided to make a Github that allows us to get the suggestions right in a Github pull request. 

## How The GitHub Bot Works

Once you have followed all the steps and integrated the bot into your repository, the bot can make suggestions when you comment "ai fix: \<path to file>". The bot will then make commit suggestion comments in the form of a pull request review.\
