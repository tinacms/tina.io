TinaCMS Version `0.69.7` brings some fixes, improved error handling, and overall DX improvements.

## Simpler "router" API

Route-mapping can now be configured within a collection's definition.

```tsx
// ...
  name: 'post',
  path: 'posts',
  ui: {
    router: ({ document }) => {
      // eg. post items can be previewed at posts/hello-world
      return `/posts/${document._sys.filename}`;
    },
  },
// ...
```

[See docs](https://tina.io/docs/tinacms-context/#the-router-property)

## Simpler "Global Forms" API

A collection can be marked as "global", from within a collection's definition.

```tsx
// ...
name: 'post',
path: 'posts',
ui: {
  global: true
},
// ...
```

Global forms can be edited from any page. They are accessed through the sidebar

## Event Log UI

The sidebar now links to an "Event Log" UI, which makes it easier to debug things like the GitHub to Tina connection being broken.
