Form fields are the bread and butter of any CMS. While Tina provides a solid collection of fields 'out-of-the-box', you can also create your own. This post will show you the basic concepts of how to create custom field components and use them in the Tina sidebar.

**Prerequisites 👩‍🏫**

Throughout the post, I'll refer to a few core TinaCMS concepts such as [forms](https://tinacms.org/docs/plugins/forms), the sidebar, and [fields](https://tinacms.org/docs/plugins/fields). It will be helpful to have some basic working knowledge of [**how TinaCMS works**](https://tinacms.org/docs/getting-started/introduction) before reading.

## Why would you create a custom field?

Tina was intended to be fully customizable and extensible. Creating **custom fields can provide precise control** over the sidebar configuration and styling, along with implementing unique field functionality.

Feel free to check out a **[finished version](https://github.com/kendallstrautman/llama-filters) of the custom range input field** seen in the gif above, or take a peak at a more complex [_Authors_ field plugin](https://github.com/tinacms/tina-starter-grande/blob/master/src/fields/authors.js) in the Tina Grande repo.

## Two Methods — Let’s start simple

There are two ways to add [custom fields](https://tinacms.org/docs/plugins/fields/custom-fields) to Tina. The first approach involves _defining a React component and passing it into the `component` property_ of a field definition. The Tina Team refers to this as an **inline field component.** This option is more straightforward; it will be the method of focus in this post.

The second approach involves defining a custom component, then registering that component as a [field plugin](https://tinacms.org/docs/plugins/fields/custom-fields#2-creating-field-plugins) with the CMS. All the [core fields](https://tinacms.org/docs/plugins/fields) provided by Tina are used as plugins.

There are some advantages to creating a plugin versus an inline field — the main points being reusability and access to additional functions for parsing, validation etc. But **for simpler cases**, when you need a custom field in just one form or don’t necessarily need validation, an inline field component will do just fine 👌.

## Creating a custom inline field

Say we have a [Tina Form](https://tinacms.org/docs/plugins/forms) set up for an _About Me_ page:

> _Note:_ The examples below will be referencing a Next.js setup, but this approach can be applied to Gatsby as well.

```js
const formOptions = {
  label: 'About Me Page',
  fields: [
    {
      label: 'Name',
      name: 'name',
      component: 'text',
    },
    {
      label: 'Hometown',
      name: 'hometown',
      component: 'text',
    },
    {
      label: 'Color',
      name: 'background_color',
      description: 'Background Color',
      component: 'color',
    },
  ],
}
```

We could add a custom inline field component to further organize the sidebar:

```js
const formOptions = {
  label: 'Info Page',
  fields: [
    {
      label: 'Name',
      name: 'name',
      component: 'text',
    },
    {
      label: 'Hometown',
      name: 'hometown',
      component: 'text',
    },
    // This is our custom inline field 👀
    {
      name: '_',
      component: () => <h4>Page Styles</h4>,
    },
    {
      label: 'Color',
      name: 'background_color',
      description: 'Background Color',
      component: 'color',
    },
  ],
}
```

_Pretty cool huh?_ 🤩

Notice how in all of the other field objects, the `component` property is referencing a Tina field plugin, whereas **with our custom inline field, we are passing in a React component.**

![Custom Inline Field In Sidbar](/img/blog/custom-field-inline.png)

Now this example component is super simple — a glorified label. This type of component can be helpful with organizing or customizing the sidebar, but _we can go further and pass in more complex fields_.

## Custom Range Slider 🎨

Say we had an image on the _About Me_ page and we wanted to be able to control some [CSS filters](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/f/filter/) on that image. The pen below shows all the CSS filters we have to play with.

  (<a href='https://codepen.io/kendallstrautman'>@kendallstrautman</a>) on <a href='https://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.
</iframe>

We can create a custom input field to provide editing control over these visual filters. **Let’s make a custom field that controls image saturation.**

> **Tip:** Saturation in photography relates to the _intensity of particular colors in an image_. A highly saturated image would be very bright, with colors bordering on neon. An image with low saturation would appear muted and grey.

### 1. Create the input field component

To create a custom input field, we need to make a **React component that takes input and updates data when the input is altered**. For this example, we are going to make a [range input field](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/range) that handles the state of the saturation value and updates that state whenever the range control is slid.

```jsx
// An example of a custom range field component
function RangeInput(props) {
  return (
    <>
      <div>
        <label htmlFor="saturation">Image Saturation</label>
      </div>
      <div>
        <input
          name="saturation"
          id="saturation"
          type="range"
          min="0"
          max="10"
          step=".1"
          /*
           ** This special input
           ** object sets essential
           ** input props: value,
           ** onChange, onFocus etc.
           */
          {...props.input}
        />
      </div>
    </>
  )
}
```

#### 👽 Take a closer look — Props:

Notice this line, `{...props.input}`. You may be wondering where this magical object with all of the necessary input props is coming from?

When the custom field is registered with Tina, this **input object** is passed in as a prop to the field. This object contains necessary data and callbacks for the input to function properly: [`value`](https://final-form.org/docs/react-final-form/types/FieldRenderProps#inputvalue), [`name`](https://final-form.org/docs/react-final-form/types/FieldRenderProps#inputname), [`onChange`](https://final-form.org/docs/react-final-form/types/FieldRenderProps#inputonchange), [`onFocus`](https://final-form.org/docs/react-final-form/types/FieldRenderProps#inputonfocus), [`onBlur`](https://final-form.org/docs/react-final-form/types/FieldRenderProps#inputonblur).

> If your custom component is not a standard [HTML input element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input), you will need to manually pass in the necessary input props, as opposed to using the [spread operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax).

**All of the props** passed to the field component are:

- `field` — A reference to the [field definition](https://tinacms.org/docs/plugins/fields).
- `input` — The object with data and callbacks for the field to set and update data. _Outlined above_ ☝️.
- `meta` — This provides [metadata](https://final-form.org/docs/react-final-form/types/FieldRenderProps#metaactive) about the state of the field.
- `tinaForm` — A reference to the form where this field is registerd.

The [react-final-form documentation](https://final-form.org/docs/react-final-form/api/Field#3-connect-the-callbacks-to-your-input) describes the `input` and `meta` props incredibly well. When creating custom fields, you'll typically be accessing the `field` and `input` props.

#### Where should the custom field live?

As we saw in the first example, we can pass in the custom field component directly via the `component` property — `component: () => <p>Hi<p>`. But when we are creating more complex fields, we will most likely want to extract the field into its own function.

In the example above, `RangeInput` could be defined alongside the `AboutMe` component where the Tina form is set up:

```jsx
/*
** Custom field defined alongside
** component using a Tina Form
*/
import { useLocalJsonForm, JsonFile } from "next-tinacms-json";

export default function AboutMe(props) {
  // Tina Form config
  const [data] = useLocalJsonForm(props.data, formOptions)
  return (
    //...
  )
}

function RangeInput(props) {
  //...
}

const formOptions = {
  /*
  ** RangeInput will be referenced
  ** in the custom field definition
  */
}

AboutMe.getInitialProps = async function() {
  //...
}
```

It could also be defined in its own file and imported into the file where the Tina form options are configured:

```jsx
/*
** Custom field definition kept in
** separate file and imported
*/
import { useLocalJsonForm, JsonFile } from "next-tinacms-json";
import RangeInput from '../components/RangeInput';

export default function AboutMe(props) {
  // Tina Form config
  const [data] = useLocalJsonForm(props.data, formOptions)
  return (
    //...
  )
}

const formOptions = {
  /*
  ** RangeInput will be referenced
  ** in the custom field definition
  */
}

AboutMe.getInitialProps = async function() {
  //...
}
```

As with many things in development, the answer **depends on your usecase** 😉. Feel free to reference this [demo repo](https://github.com/kendallstrautman/llama-filters/blob/master/pages/Index.js) to see a working example structure for Next.js.

### 2. Add the value to the source data

Now that the custom input field is defined, we need to add the `image_saturation` value to our source data. The source data could be a Markdown or JSON file. If you already have a Tina Form set up, it should be linked with a data source, so head to that file.

For our example, let's say we have a local JSON file called `about.json`. This file contains the data used in the _About Me_ page. In it we can add the `image_saturation` value.

The value can be any integer or floating point number that exists between the range defined in our `RangeInput` component — 0 to 10, with a step of 0.1 (meaning each 'slide step' of the range increments or decrements the value by 0.1). As a saturation value, **zero would be totally grayscale** or no color, so we can fill in something like 3 to get a more 'normal' look.

```JSON
// Example About Me Page source data --> about.json
{
 “name”: “Koba Weasley”,
 “hometown”: “Bend, Oregon”,
 "background_color": "#B1BCBC",
 "image_saturation": 3,
}
```

> If you’re using Gatsby, you will **need to update your GraphQL query** to get this new data. Add the `image_saturation` field to your query.

So now we have a source value that can be connected to the custom input field. This way, **Tina can update the value in the source file** in sync with the changes picked up by the `RangeInput` component.

### 3. Add the custom field to a Tina Form

How about we wire up this custom field to Tina? 🎊

In this step, we need to create the custom field definition and pass in the `RangeInput` component inline. We'll go back to our _About Me_ page [form options](/guides/gatsby/git/customize-form):

```jsx
const formOptions = {
  label: 'About Me Page',
  fields: [
    {
      label: 'Name',
      name: 'name',
      component: 'text',
    },
    {
      label: 'Hometown',
      name: 'hometown',
      component: 'text',
    },
    {
      name: '',
      component: () => <h4>Page Styles</h4>,
    },
    // Pass `RangeInput` to the `component` property
    {
      label: 'Image Saturation',
      name: 'image_saturation',
      component: RangeInput,
    },
    {
      label: 'Color',
      name: 'background_color',
      description: 'Background Color',
      component: 'color',
    },
  ],
}
```

Start the development server and you should see the custom `RangeInput` field in the sidebar. If you slide it, you should see the value updating in `about.json`.

### 4. Dynamically set the CSS filter

If all went well, our custom input field should be wired up, but there's one last thing to do. We haven’t connected the _saturation value_ with a CSS filter to actually see an effect on the image.

In order to do this, you’ll need to be using a [_CSS-in-JS_](https://css-tricks.com/bridging-the-gap-between-css-and-javascript-css-in-js/) framework so we can dynamically update the filter values through the component props. If you’re using Next.js, `styled-jsx` works out-of-the-box and is pretty fantastic. Below is an example of the _saturation value_ being connected to the CSS filter with `styled-jsx`:

```jsx
/*
 **  Example component for the
 **  About Me page in Next.js
 */
import { useLocalJsonForm } from 'next-tinacms-json'

function AboutMe(props) {
  const [data] = useLocalJsonForm(props.data, formOptions)
  return (
    <Layout bgColor={data.background_color}>
      <section>
        <h1>Hi 👩‍🎤 my name is {data.name}</h1>
        <p>Currently gallivanting around {data.hometown}</p>
        {/* This is the image that will get the treatment */}
        <img
          alt="random-unsplash"
          src="https://source.unsplash.com/random/800x600"
        />
      </section>
      {/* Pass in the image_saturation value */}
      <style jsx>{`
        img {
          filter: saturate(${data.image_saturation});
        }
      `}</style>
    </Layout>
  )
}
```

Some other examples of awesome _CSS-in-JS_ frameworks are [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/) and [emotion.js](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction). Note that the above implementation for these alternative frameworks this will look slightly different.

### Next Steps

A good next step would be _adding styles to the custom `RangeInput` component_. You could use [`@tinacms/styles`](https://tinacms.org/docs/plugins/fields/custom-fields#using-tina-styles) to fit the vibe of other Tina fields ✌️. Or you could go wild and spice up the sidebar in your own way 🤠.

If we wanted to reuse this component throughout the site, **we could take a step further and make it into a [Field Plugin](https://tinacms.org/docs/plugins/fields/custom-fields#2-creating-field-plugins)**. Stay tuned for a follow-up post that dives into creating custom Field Plugins, or swing by the [docs](https://tinacms.org/docs/plugins/fields/custom-fields#2-creating-field-plugins) to get a head start.

### Takeaways 🕺🏻

Making custom field components for TinaCMS is incredibly exciting! Hopefully this post got your creative gears turning on the numerous variables to tinker with in the content editing experience.

I think the biggest takeaway from this short exploration of custom fields is that **you can put any React component into the sidebar**. This flexibility is very powerful; it opens the door for you to custom-tune the editing controls for a project depending on its unique needs. And while creating custom components may not be necessary all the time, simply knowing it’s an option is reassuring, if not inspiring.
