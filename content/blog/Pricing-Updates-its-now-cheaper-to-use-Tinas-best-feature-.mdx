TinaCMS has some exciting news for our herd!

🦙Since SSW acquired TinaCMS, the 2 most common questions we've received are:

1. Do we have plans to increase the pricing?
2. How can I get the cool editorial workflow feature?

So, let's answer both now with some good news!  

🎉 The TinaCMS team are at Copenhagen Developers Festival (aka NDC Copenhagen) and have unveiled some game-changing pricing updates plus bringing the Editorial Workflow feature to a cheaper tier. 

First up, we’ve slashed the cost of our **Business Plan** from $599/month to just $299/month, making it more affordable for businesses to scale their content operations.

We’ve come up with a perfect solution for mid-sized teams by introducing a brand-new pricing tier: **Team Plus**.
For only $49/month, you’ll gain access to our Editorial Workflow feature, previously locked behind the more expensive Business and Enterprise plans.
Now, more users can experience seamless content collaboration ✨

These updates will empower teams of all sizes, providing a better content management workflow.
