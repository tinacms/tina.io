If previewing is needed, we recommend setting up visual editing for a live  preview.\n* Tina only supports GitHub repositories at this time.\n* Tina offers an API so you can query for your content much like you would with a traditional headless CMS. This supports complex queries (filter, sort, etc), server-side rendering, client-side rendering, and incremental static regeneration.\n\nYou can see a full list of missing features between Forestry.io and TinaCMS [here](https://tina.io/docs/forestry/missing-forestry-features/).\n"
