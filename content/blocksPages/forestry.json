          "answer": "Forestry and Tina share a lot in common but there are some key differences.\n\n* Tina's UI is an open-source single page application that you host with your site (i.e. mysite.com/admin).\n* Tina does not have a preview button like Forestry. If previewing is needed, we recommend setting up visual editing for a live  preview. \n* Tina only supports GitHub repositories at this time.\n* Tina offers an API so you can query for your content much like you would with a traditional headless CMS. This supports complex queries (filter, sort, etc), server-side rendering, client-side rendering, and incremental static regeneration. \n\nYou can see a full list of missing features between Forestry.io and TinaCMS [here](https://tina.io/docs/forestry/missing-forestry-features/).\n"
