## Overarching Process

Tina has three main branches:

* **master:** The bleeding edge of tinacms
* **next:** A preview of the next release
* **latest:** The current stable release

The flow of changes therefore looks like:

> `fix-some-bug` => `master` => `next` => `latest`

The process happens over a week:

* On Monday
  1. `next` is merged into `latest`; then `latest` is published to npm
  2. `master` is merged into `next`; then `next` is published to npm
* Any hot fixes for bugs will be cherry picked into `next` and `latest`
  and the published accordingly.
* Every pull request merged to `master` automatically triggers a
  `canary` release.

With this process:

* all accepted changes are available as `canary` releases for early testing
* critical fixes are published as soon as possible
* new features and minor fixes take \~1.5 weeks to be published

## Steps to Release

The general release process looks like this:

1. **Build the source files:**

   The source must be compiled, minified, and uglified in preparation for release.
2. **Generate CHANGELOGs and Git tags:**

   We use `lerna` to generate CHANGELOG files automatically from our commit messages.
3. **Clean the CHANGELOGs**

   Lerna sometimes adds empty changelog entries. For example, if `react-tinacms` is changed
   then `tinacms` will get get a patch update with only the dependency updated. Make sure to install `lerna-clean-changelog-cli`:

   `npm i -g lerna-clean-changelogs-cli`
4. **Publish to NPM:**

   You must have an NPM\_TOKEN set locally that has access to the `@tinacms` organization
5. **Push CHANGELOGs and Git tags to GitHub:**

   Let everyone know!

The exact commands vary slightly depending on the type of release being made.

### Prerelease

1. **Build the source files:**

   `npm run build`
2. **Generate CHANGELOGs and Git tags:**

   `lerna version \   --conventional-commits \   --conventional-prerelease \   --no-push \   --allow-branch next \
     -m "chore(publish): prerelease"`
3. **Clean the CHANGELOGs**

   `lcc ** && git commit -am "chore: clean changelogs"`
4. **Publish to NPM:**
   `lerna publish from-package --dist-tag next`
5. **Push CHANGELOGs and Git tags to GitHub:**
   `git push && git push --tags`

### Graduating Prereleases

1. **Build the source files:**

   `npm run build`
2. **Generate CHANGELOGs and Git tags:**

   `lerna version \   --conventional-commits \   --conventional-graduate \   --no-push \   --allow-branch next \
     -m "chore(publish): graduation"`
3. **Clean the CHANGELOGs**

   `lcc ** && git commit -am "chore: clean changelogs"`
