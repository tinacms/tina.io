  description: Guidelines for maintaining consistent branding, tone, and writing style when contributing to TinaCMS documentation and blog posts
---

This document should be used as a guideline when writing documentation and blog posts on [tinacms.io](http://tinacms.io)

## Brand

* Capitalization: Tina, TinaCMS, TinaCloud
* When discussing the project as a whole, **Tina** and **TinaCMS** can be used interchangeably.
* Prefer **Tina** over **TinaCMS** when discussing specific packages or components and their relation to the project.
  * *Example: "The sidebar is the primary interface in **Tina**."*

## Tone

* Aim for a friendly, personal tone
* Documentation and tutorials should feel free to address the reader
  * *Example: "If **you** want to see a glimpse of what **you** can do with a blocks-based content strategy, fork Tina Grande and give it a try."*
* Tutorial steps should use an inclusive POV ("we" over "you")
  * *Example:"**Let’s** say, instead of a single name, **we’re** storing a list of names like this:"*
* While you don't need to follow it dogmatically, running your drafts through the [Hemingway Editor](http://hemingwayapp.com/) can help identify overly complicated prose.

## Formatting

* Inline and block `code tags` should be reserved **exclusively** for communicating code.
  * "Code" in this case can include source code, terminal commands, variable names, and package names.
  * The above is not meant to be an exhaustive list, but use your best judgement.
  * Avoid `code tags` when discussing interface elements (such as navigation menus and in-app actions). Opt for **bold** text instead.
  * Code blocks should be made [copy-able](https://github.com/tinacms/tinacms.org/blob/master/README.md#copy-able-code-block) unless they show more context then should be copied (i.e. `diffs`)
* Important concepts should be formatted in **bold (strong emphasis)**.
* Other points of emphasis can be formatted in *italics (normal emphasis)*, or **bold (strong emphasis)** as appropriate.
* When *an emphasized phrase* appears near a **highlighted concept**, opt for *italics* over **bold** for the former.
* **Avoid emphasis fatigue!** Too much emphasized text clustered together will lose its emphasis. Over-reliance on emphasis may indicate a lack of clarity in the writing.

### Headings

* Each document should have a single top-level heading. On the tinacms.org website, this is handled by the `title` front matter field.
* Headings should follow strict hierarchy. Don't nest an `h3` directly inside an `h1` without an `h2` in between.
* Don't nest headings more than three levels deep, inclusive of the top-level heading (`h1` > `h2` > `h3`). If you find the need to use a fourth-level heading, consider reorganizing the document or splitting it up.
* Headings can include *italics*, but avoid **bold text** or `code tags`.
  * Use *italics* formatting for code-like items when present in headings
* Make an effort to capitalize titles appropriately. Check out [title.sh](https://title.sh/) for help.

### Links

* Avoid using `code tags` in [links](https://tinacms.io).
* [Links](https://tinacms.io) should stand out *consistently* from their surrounding text; avoid applying additional formatting. *[Links](https://tinacms.io) appearing within emphasized text* may be **[formatted](https://tinacms.io)** **appropriately**.
* Link text should flow naturally in prose and relate semantically to the link target. Basically, just don't use "[click here](https://tinacms.io)".
  * *Example: "swing by [our community forum](https://tina.io/community/)"*
