By default Tina doesn't provide any opinionated file name constraints. This is because most operating systems provide a variety of file name configurations and we didn't want users to be constrained. If you need to enforce file name constraints at the collection level, Tina provides a few options for you.

Please be aware of the following limitations with Tina if you do decide to do decide to implement filename customization:

Filename must contain only a-z, A-Z, 0-9, -, \_, ., or [/.](/.)

The slugify function is useful for when you want the file name to be derived from other field(s). By default

A couple things to keep in mind when customizing the filename:

* File names cannot contain spaces
* The filename generated cannot be a duplicate within the collection
* If the filename starts with `/` it will be treated as an absolute path relative to the collection root
  * Example: `/foo/bar/blog-post` will be saved as `<MyCollectionPath>/post/blog-post.md`
* If the filename does not start with `/` it will be treated as a relative to your current folder
  * Example: `bar/blog-post` will be saved as `<MyCollectionPath>/<CurrentDirectory>/bar/blog-post.md`

## Definition

| Property               | Description                                                              |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `ui.filename.readonly` | Disable the editor from editing the filename                             |
| `ui.filename.slugify`  | A function that takes in the values of the form and returns the filename |

## Usage

To use the filename customization API, you need to pass a `slugify` function that allows you to customize the filename of a document based on its content.

### Example with slugify and disabled

```ts
export default defineConfig({
  //...
  schema: {
    collections: [
      {
        label: 'Blog Posts',
        name: 'post',
        path: 'content/post',
        format: 'md',
        ui: {
          filename: {
            // if disabled, the editor can not edit the filename
            readonly: true,
            // Example of using a custom slugify function
            slugify: (values) => {
              // Values is an object containing all the values of the form. In this case it is {title?: string, topic?: string}
              return `${values?.topic || 'no-topic'}-${values?.title
                ?.toLowerCase()
                .replace(/ /g, '-')}`
            },
          },
        },
        fields: [
          {
            type: 'string',
            label: 'Title',
            name: 'title',
          },
          {
            type: 'string',
            label: 'Topic',
            name: 'topic',
            options: ['programming', 'blacksmithing'],
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
})
```

### Example with default slugify

If no slugify function is provided and there is a field with `isTitle: true`. A default slugify function will be used that strips out every non-alphanumeric character and replaces spaces with dashes.

```ts
export default defineConfig({
  //...
  schema: {
    collections: [
      {
        label: 'Blog Posts',
        name: 'post',
        path: 'content/post',
        format: 'md',
        fields: [
          {
            type: 'string',
            label: 'Title',
            name: 'title',
            // If no slugify function is provided, then by default the "title" field will be used to generate the filename
            isTitle: true,
            required: true,
          },
          {
            type: 'string',
            label: 'Topic',
            name: 'topic',
            options: ['programming', 'blacksmithing'],
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
})
```
