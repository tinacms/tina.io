## Manually toggling via `useEditState`

You can manually enter and exit edit mode by tapping into the `useEditState` hook. You should **always** have a [`/pages/admin.{js,tsx}` file](/docs/tinacms-context/#toggling-edit-mode) but in some cases you may want to go into edit mode without going to the `/admin` or `/admin#/logout` routes.

In this case you can use the `useEditState` hook. This will enter you into edit mode (and trigger a tina cloud login if applicable).

For example, you may wish to provide your editors with a button to login and logout without having to navigate to `/admin` and `/admin#/logout`.

```tsx
import { useEditState } from 'tinacms/dist/edit-state'

const MyEditButton = () => {
  const { edit, setEdit } = useEditState()

  return (
    <button
      onClick={() => {
        setEdit(editState => !editState)
      }}
    >
      {edit ? 'exit exit mode' : 'Enter edit mode'}
    </button>
  )
}
```

Another example is that you may have UI on a page that you only want editors to see.

```tsx
import { useEditState } from 'tinacms/dist/edit-state'

const MyPublicPage = () => {
  const { edit } = useEditState()

  return (
    <div>
      <main>public content....</main>
      {edit && <EditorOnlyUI />}
    </div>
  )
}
```

Note that the `tinacms/dist/edit-state (>2kb)` code _will_ be in your production bundle with this pattern.
