## Introduction

For the most part, TinaCMS is framework-agnostic. Unless you're using "visual editing", the setup is mostly the same regardless of the site's framework.

We also have some guides tailored for some popular frameworks:

* ðŸ‘‘ **[Next.js](/docs/frameworks/next/overview)**
* [Astro](/docs/frameworks/astro/)
* [Hugo](/docs/frameworks/hugo/)
* [Remix](/docs/frameworks/remix/)
* [Gatsby](/docs/frameworks/gatsby/)
* [Jekyll](/docs/frameworks/jekyll/)
* [11ty](/docs/frameworks/11ty/)

## Coming soon

* Nuxt

Note: popularity can be seen from Google Trends

## Getting Started

From within your site's directory, run:

```bash
 npx @tinacms/cli@latest init
```

This will ask you a few setup questions.

When prompted for the "**public assets directory**", see our [list of frameworks](/docs/integration/frameworks/) for help.

## Updating your build scripts

Depending on your framework, `tina init` may try to update your `package.json` scripts.

```json
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "tinacms dev -c \"next dev\"",
    "build": "tinacms build && next build",
    "start": "tinacms build && next start"
  }
```

These should be applied manually if they haven't been set by the CLI.

## Model your content

To edit your site's content in Tina, you can model your content in the tina/config.ts file.

Learn more about content modelling [here](/docs/schema/)

## Starting TinaCMS

You can start TinaCMS with:

```bash
npx tinacms dev -c "<your-dev-process>"
```

> `<your-dev-process>`can be replaced with your site's custom dev command.

With TinaCMS running, navigate to `http://localhost:3000/admin/index.html`

> ^ The above default port may differ depending on your framework.

> Hint: If you are getting error when running this command please see the [Common Errors](/docs/forestry/common-errors) page.

At this point, you should be able to see the Tina admin, select a post, save changes, and see the changes persisted to your local markdown files.

## Setting up Visual Editing (Optional)

If you want to power your pages with TinaCMS's API, and you're using a React-based framework, you may be able to leverage TinaCMS's visual editing features.
