## Introduction

TinaCMS can be added to your SvelteKit site locally. In this doc, we'll guide through the local setup, as well as editing on your production site.

## Getting Started

From within your site's directory, run:

```bash
 npx @tinacms/cli@latest init
```

This will ask you a few setup questions.

> If you are importing your site from Forestry.io CMS, some models & config will be auto-imported.

## Updating your build scripts

```json
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "tinacms dev -c \"vite dev\"",
		"build": "tinacms build && vite build",
		"preview": "tinacms build && vite preview",
  }
```

## Move static files

TinaCMS would assume your static files would be in the `public` directory. But SvelteKit serves statics files in the `static` directory. So you need to move your static files to the `static` directory.

Confirm you have both directories under statics:

```bash
 # Tina admin
 static/admin/index.html
 
 # Tina media/images
 static/images
```

## Adjust tina configuration

Update the output directories to aim the `static` directory used by SveteKit

```js
import { defineConfig } from 'tinacms';
export default defineConfig({
  // ... other config
  clientId: process.env.PUBLIC_TINA_CLIENT_ID,
  token: process.env.TINA_TOKEN,
  build: {
    outputFolder: 'admin',      // This creates static/admin
    publicFolder: 'static'      // REQUIRED for SvelteKit
  },
  media: {
    tina: {
      mediaRoot: 'images',      // Folder inside static/
      publicFolder: 'static'    // REQUIRED for SvelteKit
    }
  },
  schema: {
    collections: [
      {
        name: 'post',
        label: 'Posts',
        path: 'content/posts', // Where your markdown files live
        fields: [ /* ... */ ]
      }
    ]
  }
});
```

## Model your content

To edit your site's content in Tina, you can model your content in the tina/config.ts file.

Learn more about content modelling [here](/docs/schema/)

## Starting TinaCMS

You can start TinaCMS with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

With TinaCMS running, navigate to `http://localhost:5173/admin/index.html`

> Hint: If you are getting error when running this command please see the [Common Errors](/docs/forestry/common-errors) page.

At this point, you should be able to see the Tina admin, select a post, save changes, and see the changes persisted to your local markdown files.
