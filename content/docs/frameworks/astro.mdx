TinaCMS can be added to your Astro site locally, enabling seamless content management and editing. This guide will walk you through the local setup, configuring your content model, running TinaCMS, and enabling visual editing.

## Getting Started

### 1. Initialize TinaCMS in Your Astro Site

From within your site’s root directory, run the following command to initialize TinaCMS:

```bash
npx @tinacms/cli@latest init
```

This command will prompt you with a few setup questions. When asked for the **public assets directory**, enter:

```
public
```

Alternatively, you can use the TinaCMS starter template by running:

```bash
npx create-tina-app@latest --template tina-astro-starter
```

This will set up a blog-ready [Astro Starter Template](https://github.com/tinacms/tina-astro-starter) with TinaCMS preconfigured.

## Modeling Your Content

To edit your site’s content using TinaCMS, define your content models in the `tina/config.ts` file.

Learn more about content modeling [here](/docs/schema/).

## Running TinaCMS

You can start TinaCMS with the following command:

```bash
npx tinacms dev -c "astro dev"
```

> Note: `--port 8080` can be added after `astro dev` to specify a custom port. 

Once TinaCMS is running, navigate to:

```
http://localhost:<port>/admin/index.html
or
/admin (If using the Tina Astro Starter which redirects you to /admin/index.html)
```

> **Tip:** If you encounter errors, check the [Common Errors](/docs/forestry/common-errors) page.

At this point, you should be able to see the Tina admin interface, select a post, save changes, and observe updates persisting to your local markdown files.

## Enabling Visual Editing (Optional)

If you want to leverage TinaCMS's API for real-time editing, you can enable Visual Editing.\
\


> Note: In the [Astro Starter Template](https://github.com/tinacms/tina-astro-starter) this is already enabled!
