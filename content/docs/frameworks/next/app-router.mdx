## Installing dependencies

From within your site's directory, run:

```bash
npx @tinacms/cli@latest init
```

This will ask you a few setup questions. When prompted for the **public assets directory**, enter: **public**.

## Updating your build scripts

`tina init` should have updated your `package.json` scripts.

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "tinacms dev -c \"next dev\"",
  "build": "tinacms build && next build",
  "start": "tinacms build && next start"
}
```

These should be applied manually if they haven't been set by the CLI.

## Starting TinaCMS

You can start TinaCMS with:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

**We recommend using pnpm.**

With TinaCMS running, navigate to `http://localhost:3000/admin/index.html`.

> ❓ Hint: If you are getting errors when running this command, please see the [Common Errors](/docs/forestry/common-errors) page.

At this point, you should be able to see the Tina admin, select a post, save changes, and see the changes persisted to your local markdown files.

## TinaCMS Config file

After running the `tina init` command a few files were created to get you started as quick as possible. One of these is the `tina/config.ts` file. This is a required config file that defines all the tina schemas.

It looks like the following:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from 'tinacms'

// Your hosting provider likely exposes this as an environment variable
const branch =
  process.env.GITHUB_BRANCH ||
  process.env.VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_REF ||
  process.env.HEAD ||
  'main'

export default defineConfig({
  branch,

  // Get this from tina.io
  clientId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_TINA_CLIENT_ID,
  // Get this from tina.io
  token: process.env.TINA_TOKEN,

  build: {
    outputFolder: 'admin',
    publicFolder: 'public',
  },
  media: {
    tina: {
      mediaRoot: '',
      publicFolder: 'public',
    },
  },
  schema: {
    collections: [
      {
        name: 'post',
        label: 'Posts',
        path: 'content/posts',
        fields: [
          {
            type: 'string',
            name: 'title',
            label: 'Title',
            isTitle: true,
            required: true,
          },
          {
            type: 'rich-text',
            name: 'body',
            label: 'Body',
            isBody: true,
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
})
```

**For a more detailed overview about the config see [Content Modeling with TinaCMS](docs/extending-tina/overview/)**

> 💡 If you've followed this guide using the `tina  init` command, you might have noticed that a `content` and a `pages` folder got created:

```bash
Adding file at content/posts/hello-world.md... ✅
Adding file at pages/demo/blog/[filename].tsx... ✅
```

> These can be used as a quick reference but are safe to delete.

## Creating a New Post

> 💡 As defined in the `tina/config.ts` file we have 1 collection called `post` which will be picked up by TinaCMS and mapped to what you see in the TinaCMS Admin page.

1.Head over to `/admin/index.html`

2.Click on Posts

3.Click on Create

4.Enter required fields

5.Save

Now, let's go back and check what was created. You will see a `/content` folder with your new post saved as a `.md` file. This path is defined in the `tina/config.ts` files post collection!

```bash
content
    └── posts
        └── hello-world.md
```

## Rendering the Post Collection

Let's start by creating a `/posts` folder. The page here will list all our posts.

**File:** `app/posts/page.tsx`

```tsx
import PostList from './client-page'
import { client } from '../../tina/__generated__/client'

export default async function Page() {
  const { data } = await client.queries.postConnection()

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Posts</h1>
      <div>
        {data.postConnection.edges.map((post) => (
          <div key={post.node.id}>
            <Link href={`/posts/${post.node._sys.filename}`}>
              {post.node._sys.filename}
            </Link>
          </div>
        ))}
      </div>
    </>
  )
}
```

As you may have noticed this is a Server Rendered page. Depending on how this page is generated can mean Next will either,

- **A. Build this as a Dynamic / Server Rendered page**
- **B. Build this as a Static page.**

This is up to you on how you want this page to be rendered.

## Rendering a Single Post

To make this work with TinaCMS Visual Editor we are going to break this across 2 components. 1 will build the page at build time. The other will be a client rendered page that can interact and work with TinaCMS.

**File:** `app/posts/[...filename].tsx`

```tsx
import Post from './client-page'
import client from '../../../tina/__generated__/client'

export async function generateStaticParams() {
  const pages = await client.queries.postConnection()
  const paths = pages.data?.postConnection?.edges?.map((edge) => ({
    filename: edge?.node?._sys.breadcrumbs,
  }))

  return paths || []
}

export default async function PostPage({
  params,
}: {
  params: { filename: string[] }
}) {
  const data = await client.queries.post({
    relativePath: `${params.filename}.md`,
  })

  return <Post {...data}></Post>
}
```

Here we are using [generateStaticParams](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-static-params) to build these pages as SSG. You are free to change this however you like.

Now to make the Visual Editor work, we will create a new "client page":

**File:** `app/posts/[...filename]/client-page.tsx`

```tsx
'use client'
import { useTina } from 'tinacms/dist/react'
import { PostQuery } from '../../../tina/__generated__/types'

interface ClientPageProps {
  query: string
  variables: {
    relativePath: string
  }
  data: PostQuery
}

export default function Post(props: ClientPageProps) {
  // data passes though in production mode and data is updated to the sidebar data in edit-mode
  const { data } = useTina({
    query: props.query,
    variables: props.variables,
    data: props.data,
  })
  return (
    <code>
      <pre
        style={{
          backgroundColor: 'lightgray',
        }}
      >
        {JSON.stringify(data.post, null, 2)}
      </pre>
    </code>
  )
}
```
