## Events

Tina has a simple **Event Bus** that lets different parts of the CMS communicate with each other. It's possible to hook into some of these events yourself, as well as use Tina's event bus to send and receive your own events.

## Plugins

Tina's **plugin system** is used extensively by its own libraries, and serves as the foundation for much of its extensibility.

## Screens

**Screens** are a type of plugin that allow you to add custom control panels to Tina. Some examples of screen plugins include [site-level forms](/docs/plugins/screens/#useformscreenplugin) and the [media manager](/docs/cms/media).
