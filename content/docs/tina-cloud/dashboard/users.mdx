The **Collaborations** tab of a project allows users manage a project.

Project collaborators can have one of the following project-level roles:

* Editor
* Admin

The following roles/permissions apply to "Project Admins" & "Project Editors":

| Actions                      | Project Admin | Project Editor |
| ---------------------------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| Edit Project Content         | ✔️            | ✔️             |
| View Project Overview        | ✔️            | ✔️             |
| Manage Project Configuration | ✔️            | ❌              |
| Manage Project Collaborators | ✔️            | ❌              |

Both Admins and Editors are authorized to access the editing route on a Tina configured site. Both users can save content changes directly to a site's GitHub repository using TinaCMS.

> When a site is configured to use Tina Cloud, an authorized user will be prompted for their Tina Cloud credentials to access the editing route of the site.
