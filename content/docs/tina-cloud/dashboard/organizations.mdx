Organizations make it easy to manage users across multiple projects.

Each user can belong to multiple organization. The organization can be toggled with the top left dropdown.

Each user in an organization can have one of the following org-level roles:

- Editor
- Admin

The following roles/permissions apply to "Org Admins" & "Org Editors":

| Actions                            | Org Admin | Org Editor |
| ---------------------------------- | --------- | ---------- |
| Create new projects                | ✔️        | ✔️         |
| List **all** organization projects | ✔️        | ❌         |
| Manage project collaborators       | ✔️        | ❌         |
| Edit project content               | ❌        | ❌         |

In order to sign in to a project and edit through TinaCMS, the org user needs to be explicitly added to the given project.
