> Note: The editorial workflow feature is available on select paid plans.

If you need to automate tasks or trigger external processes when your content is updated, you can leverage the new webhooks feature. When content is pushed or modified to your desired branch, TinaCMS can send a notification to your own server. This payload includes the paths of the modified files, allowing you to automatically trigger actions like rebuilding your site, populating a search index, or sending a Slack notification, creating powerful, event-driven workflows.

## Setting Up

Webhooks can be created via the "Webhooks" tab within a project.

To set up the Editorial Workflow, follow these steps:

1. Go to the "Configuration" tab of your project in the dashboard.
2. Toggle the "Enable" option.
3. Enter the names of the branches you want to protect.
4. After setting up the protected branches, refresh your page to ensure the changes take effect.
