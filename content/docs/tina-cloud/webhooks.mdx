If you need to automate tasks or trigger external processes when your content
is updated, you can leverage the new webhooks feature. When content is pushed
or modified to your desired branch, TinaCMS can send a notification to your own
server. This payload includes the paths of the modified files, allowing you to
automatically trigger actions like rebuilding your site or populating a search
index, creating powerful, event-driven workflows.

## Setting Up

Webhooks can be created via the "Webhooks" tab within a project.

To create a webhook, follow these steps:

1. Go to a project.
2. Go to the "Webhooks" tab within your project.
3. Press the "Add Webhook" button.
4. Give your webhook a name, server url, branches you'd like the webhook to
fire on, and additional headers to be sent to the your server.

# Webhook Logs

Webhook logs can be found within **Webhooks | Logs**.

The logs include the following information:
- **Date**: The date and time the webhook request was sent.
- **Status**: The status code of the webhook request.
- **Request**: The webhook request payload. More information on its format can
  be found below under the "Requests" header.
- **Response**: The response body from your server.

## Requests

Below is an example webhook request payload:

```
{
    clientId: "276...",
    branch: "main",
    paths: ["content/authors/bob", ...],
    type: "content.modified",
    eventId: "472..."
}
```

> Note: The payload `type` can be of either `['content.modified' |
> 'content.removed' | 'content.added']`
