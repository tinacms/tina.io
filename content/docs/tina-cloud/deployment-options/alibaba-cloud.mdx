Alibaba Cloud is the leading cloud service provider in China. Since China doesn't have mature GitHub-integrated hosting services like Vercel, Alibaba Cloud becomes the go-to option for developers who want to deploy their websites within mainland China.

## Alibaba Cloud Configuration

Alibaba Cloud offers a wide range of server options. We generally recommend using **Elastic Compute Service (ECS)** for TinaCMS project deployment. For detailed instructions on creating and configuring your server, please refer to the [Official Alibaba Cloud Documentation](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/elastic-compute-service).

### Server Setup

After creating your ECS instance, you'll need to set up the necessary software for manage your TinaCMS project.

#### Install PM2 for Process Management

PM2 is a process manager for Node.js applications that helps keep your application running in production.

```
pnpm install -g pm2
```

#### Install and Configure Nginx

Nginx will serve as a reverse proxy for your TinaCMS application.

```
yum install nginx
```

Next, start Nginx and enable it to run on system boot:

```
systemctl start nginx    # Start the Nginx service
systemctl enable nginx   # Configure Nginx to start automatically on system boot
systemctl status nginx   # Check the status of the Nginx service
```

#### Configure Nginx as a Reverse Proxy

Create a configuration file for your TinaCMS site:

```
vim /etc/nginx/conf.d/tinademo.conf
```

Add the following configuration:

```
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your - domain.com;  # Replace with your actual domain
  location / {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
      proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
  }
}
```

Test your Nginx configuration for syntax errors:

```
nginx -t
```

Reload Nginx to apply the new configuration:

```
nginx -s reload
```

### Preparing for GitHub Actions Deployment

#### Create Deployment Directory

First, create a directory on your server where your Tina CMS project will be deployed:

```
mkdir -p /www/tinademo
cd /www/tinademo
```

#### Generate SSH Keys for GitHub Actions

Generate an SSH key pair on your Alibaba Cloud server:

```
ssh -keygen -t ed25519 -C "deploy-key"
# Press Enter to use the default path
# Leave the passphrase empty by pressing Enter
```

#### Add Public Key to Authorized Keys

Add the generated public key to the authorized\_keys file to allow GitHub Actions to authenticate:

```
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

## Configuring GitHub Secrets

After generating your SSH key, you'll need to add several secrets to your GitHub repository to enable secure deployment.

### Navigate to GitHub Secrets

1. GitHub repository → Settings
2. Secrets and variables → Actions
3. Click "New repository secret"

### Required GitHub Secrets

You'll need to configure the following secrets:

1. `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` : The private key generated on your server
   * View it using: `cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519`
   * Make sure to include the entire key, including the `-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY----` and `-----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----`
2. `SERVER_HOST`: Your Alibaba Cloud server's IP address
   * This is the public IP address of your ECS instance
3. `SERVER_USERNAME`: The username for connecting to your server
   * Typically `root` or the user account you created on your ECS instance
4. `NEXT_PUBLIC_TINA_BRANCH`: The branch that Tina CMS should use for content
   * Usually your main branch (e.g., `main`  or `master`)
5. `NEXT_PUBLIC_TINA_CLIENT_ID`: Your Tina Cloud client ID
   * Find this in your Tina Cloud dashboard under project settings
6. `TINA_TOKEN`: Your Tina Cloud token for authentication
   * Generate this from your Tina Cloud dashboard under API Access

## Creating GitHub Actions Workflow

Create a new file in your repository at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` with the following content:

```yaml
name: Deploy to Alibaba Cloud Server

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: "22.14.0"

      - name: Setup pnpm
        uses: pnpm/action-setup@v2
        with:
          version: 8

      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: pnpm install

      - name: Create .env file
        run: |
          cat > .env << EOL
          NEXT_PUBLIC_TINA_CLIENT_ID=${{ secrets.NEXT_PUBLIC_TINA_CLIENT_ID }}
          TINA_TOKEN=${{ secrets.TINA_TOKEN }}
          NEXT_PUBLIC_TINA_BRANCH=${{ secrets.NEXT_PUBLIC_TINA_BRANCH }}
          EOL

      - name: Build
        env:
          NEXT_PUBLIC_TINA_CLIENT_ID: ${{ secrets.NEXT_PUBLIC_TINA_CLIENT_ID }}
          TINA_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.TINA_TOKEN }}
          NEXT_PUBLIC_TINA_BRANCH: ${{ secrets.NEXT_PUBLIC_TINA_BRANCH }}
        run: pnpm build

      - name: Deploy to Server
        uses: appleboy/scp-action@master
        with:
          host: ${{ secrets.SERVER_HOST }}
          username: ${{ secrets.SERVER_USERNAME }}
          key: ${{ secrets.SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }}
          source: ".next/,public/,package.json,pnpm-lock.yaml,.env,tina/,next.config.js,.tina/"
          target: "/tina/tinademo/"
          rm: true

      - name: Execute Remote SSH Commands
        uses: appleboy/ssh-action@master
        with:
          host: ${{ secrets.SERVER_HOST }}
          username: ${{ secrets.SERVER_USERNAME }}
          key: ${{ secrets.SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }}
          script: |
            cd /tina/tinademo
            pnpm install
            pm2 delete tinademo || true
            pm2 flush tinademo
            NODE_ENV=production pm2 start "pnpm start" --name tinademo

```

## Configuring a Custom Domain

To use a custom domain with your TinaCMS project in China:

### Domain Setup

1. Purchase a domain from a Chinese provider (e.g. Alibaba Cloud, Tencent Cloud)
2. Add an A record pointing to your Alibaba Cloud server's IP address
3. Update your Nginx configuration: 

```
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name yourdomain.cn;
    # Rest of configuration
}
```

### ICP Filing

Remember that websites hosted in mainland China require ICP filing. Start this process through your domain provider or Alibaba Cloud.
