## Build Configuration

In Netlify, your build configuration can be updated at **Settings** > **Build & Deploy** > **Build Command**.

![Netlify build config](https://res.cloudinary.com/forestry-demo/image/upload/v1674607585/Screen_Shot_2023-01-24_at_8.45.23_PM_gbqyqb.png 'Netlify build config')

> If your package.json has a "build" script like `tinacms build && <your-site-build-cmd>`, this likely doesn't need to be changed. If your Netlify config is not running a custom build script (e.g `next build`), you would have to change this to `tinacms build && next build`

> If your project has a `netlify.toml` with a build command set, that will take precedence over the above build command UI

## Environment variables

Assuming that your Tina `clientID` and `token` are setup as environment variables, you will need to add those to the Netlify UI for your project. You can learn more about environment variables [here](https://docs.netlify.com/environment-variables/overview/?_ga=2.128850127.213489666.1674607241-1149277376.1674150726 'netlify environment variables').
