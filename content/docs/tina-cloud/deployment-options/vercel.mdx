## Creating a new Project

To create a new project inside your team, navigate to the Add New button and you will be prompted to import your GitHub repository.

Once selected you will then need to configure the build settings.

## Build Configuration

When first deploying a new project you will be met with the build configuration page before deploying, but you can update your build configuration at **Settings** > **General** > **Build & Development Settings**.

> If your package.json has a "build" script like `tinacms build && <your-site-build-cmd>`, this likely doesn't need to be changed. If your Vercel config is not running a custom build script (e.g `next build` instead of `npm run build`), you would have to change this to `tinacms build && next build`

## Environment variables

Whatever environment variables you have defined locally in your `.env` file will need to be copied over to your Vercel project. These can be updated at any time by going to **Settings > Environment Variables**

Mandatory environment variables include the NEXT\_PUBLIC\_TINA\_CLIENT\_ID and the TINA\_TOKEN both of which can be found in your [TinaCloud project](https://app.tina.io)

## Your First Deployment

Once ready, select ‘Deploy’ and wait for your first build to run. Once it succeeds, visit your new Tina site by selecting ‘Inspect Deployment’.
