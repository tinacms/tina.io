## Build Configuration

In Vercel, your build configuration can be updated at **Settings** > **General** > **Build & Development Settings**.

> If your package.json has a "build" script like `tinacms build && <your-site-build-cmd>`, this likely doesn't need to be changed. If your Vercel config is not running a custom build script (e.g `next build` instead of `npm run build`), you would have to change this to `tinacms build && next build`

## Environment variables

Assuming that your Tina `clientID` and `token` are setup as environment variables, you will need to add those to the Vercel "Environment Variables" tab for your project.
