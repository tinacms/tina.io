title: Connecting the site

Once you've created a project in **Tina Cloud**, the next step is to connect your site. Once connected, your project's editors will be able to save content directly to its GitHub repository, entirely from within your site.

## Enabling Tina Cloud in TinaCMS

In the [Contextual Editing doc](/docs/tinacms-context/), we showed you how the Tina context is setup on your site.

To have editing work in production, in the `.tina/config.<ts|js>` file, configure the `clientId` to point to your Tina Cloud project, and add your generated `token`.

```tsx
// .tina/config.ts
//...
export default defineConfig({
  //...
  token: '<Your Read Only Token>' // generated on app.tina.io,
  clientId: '<Your Client ID>', // generated on app.tina.io
  branch,
  schema: {
    collections: [
    //...
    // See https://tina.io/docs/schema/ for more info about "collections"
  ]}
})
```

<div class="short-code-warning">
  <div>
    <p>Note ⚠️ If you're loading your schema config values from a local environment file, note that Tina's build process will only pickup `.env` files, (not `.env.local` or `.env.development` files)</p>
  </div>

  </svg>
</div>

## Configuring the branch

Typically you'll want to use the branch that you're deploying with your site. This will vary depending on your host, but most will provide an environment variable of some sort that you can use.

```diff
// .tina/config.ts
//...
+ const branch =
+  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_TINA_BRANCH ||
+  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_REF ||
+  process.env.HEAD ||
+  ''
export default defineConfig({
  //...
  token: '<Your Read Only Token>' // generated on app.tina.io,
  clientId: '<Your Client ID>', // generated on app.tina.io
  branch,
  schema: {
    collections: [
    //...
    // See https://tina.io/docs/schema/ for more info about "collections"
  ]}
})
```

> `NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_REF` is Vercel's [system environment variable](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/environment-variables#system-environment-variables) that represents the branch that has made the deployment commit.
> `HEAD` is the equivalent system environment variable used by [Netlify](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/environment-variables/#git-metadata).

Your fully configured `.tina/config.{js,ts}` should look something like this:

```ts
import {  defineConfig } from 'tinacms'

const branch =
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_TINA_BRANCH ||
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_REF ||
  process.env.HEAD

export default defineConfig({
  token: '<Your Read Only Token>' // generated on app.tina.io
  clientId: '<Your Client ID>', // generated on app.tina.io
  branch,
  schema: {
    // ...
  },
})
```

The apiURL is configured to use the local Content API in development (to query your local files), and the hosted content API (with auth) in production.

## Deploying your site (with the TinaCMS admin)

The next step is to update your deployment configuration, so the TinaCMS admin gets built alongside your site. This allows your editors to enter the CMS through `<your-site>/admin` (or `your-site/admin/index.html`).

Here are some popular deployment options:

### Option: Netlify

#### Build Configuration

In Netlify, your build configuration can be updated at **Settings** > **Build & Deploy** > **Build Command**.

![Netlify build config](http://res.cloudinary.com/forestry-demo/image/upload/v1674607585/Screen_Shot_2023-01-24_at_8.45.23_PM_gbqyqb.png 'Netlify build config')

> If your package.json has a "build" script like `tinacms && <your-site-build-cmd>`, this likely doesn't need to be changed. If your Netlify config is not running a custom build script (e.g `next build`), you would have to change this to `tinacms dev && next build`

#### Environment variables

Assuming that your Tina `clientID` and `token` are setup as environment variables, you will need to add those to the Netlify UI for your project. You can learn more about environment variables [here](https://docs.netlify.com/environment-variables/overview/?_ga=2.128850127.213489666.1674607241-1149277376.1674150726 'netlify environment variables')

### Option: Vercel

#### Build Configuration

In Vercel, your build configuration can be updated at **Settings** > **General** > **Build & Development Settings**.

![Vercel Build Settings](https://res.cloudinary.com/forestry-demo/image/upload/v1674653527/tina-io/docs/tina-cloud/vercel-build-settings_vubza8.png 'Vercel Build Settings')

> If your package.json has a "build" script like `tinacms && <your-site-build-cmd>`, this likely doesn't need to be changed. If your Vercel config is not running a custom build script (e.g `next build` instead of `npm run build`), you would have to change this to `tinacms dev && next build`

#### Environment variables

Assuming that your Tina `clientID` and `token` are setup as environment variables, you will need to add those to the Vercel "Environment Variables" tab for your project.

### Option: GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages is a popular hosting option for static sites. GitHub Pages can be configured in **<your-repo>** > **Settings** > **Pages**.

#### Build Configuration

GitHub Pages offers a few build options:

- GitHub Actions
- Deploy from a branch

![GitHub Actions](https://res.cloudinary.com/forestry-demo/image/upload/v1674654344/tina-io/docs/tina-cloud/Screen_Shot_2023-01-25_at_9.40.52_AM_fby9q2.png 'GitHub Actions')

We want to choose "**GitHub Actions**" so that we can control the build script, and make sure it's also building the TinaCMS admin

By clicking "Configure" on the action it's created for us, we can then tweak the build script to build tinacms along with our site.

Once you prepend `tinacms build && ` to your build script, your GitHub Action will look something like:

![Github Action](https://res.cloudinary.com/forestry-demo/image/upload/v1674654604/tina-io/docs/tina-cloud/github-action_co7uin.png 'Github Action')

#### Environment variables

Assuming that your Tina `clientID` and `token` are setup as environment variables, you will need to add those to the GitHub Secrets for your project. to your build script, your GitHub Action will look something like:

![Github Action](https://res.cloudinary.com/forestry-demo/image/upload/v1674654604/tina-io/docs/tina-cloud/github-action_co7uin.png 'Github Action')
