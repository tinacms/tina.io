The **Tina Cloud Dashboard** is the interface for managing the administrative aspects of your content management. The dashboard allows you to create **projects**, and setup your **users**.

A **project** connects to your site's GitHub repository and authorizes Tina Cloud to push and pull content directly from it. You can also authorize **users** to edit your site through the dashboard's user management page. Once a user has been added, they will be able to login directly to your site, start editing content, and have their changes saved to your GitHub repository.

An important distinction here is that unlike traditional CMS dashboards, Tina Cloud's dashboard is not used to edit your content. Instead, content editing capabilities are setup by you, the developer, using the TinaCMS toolkit.
