### Summary

TinaCMS is generally available and usable in mainland China. The main obstacle is the inaccessibility of static site hosting platforms, and there are no direct Chinese alternatives to these services. However, you can achieve similar functionality by combining Alibaba Cloud servers with GitHub Actions for automated deployment.
