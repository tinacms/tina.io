### Service Availability Assessment

1. **TinaCMS CLI Installation**
   * Command: `npx create-tina-app@latest`
   * Status: ✅ Accessible - The npm registry and TinaCMS CLI can be accessed without issues.
2. **TinaCloud Service**
   * Service: TinaCloud Dashboard and API
   * Status: ✅ Accessible - Both the TinaCloud dashboard and API services are fully accessible from China.
3. **GitHub**
   * Service: GitHub repository hosting
   * Status: ⚠️ Accessible but slow - GitHub is accessible but with reduced performance and occasional connectivity issues.
4. **Tina.io and Documentation**
   * Service: Tina.io documentation website
   * Status: ✅ Accessible\*\* \*\*- The official TinaCMS documentation is fully accessible.
5. **Static Site Hosting Platforms**

* Services: Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages
* Status: ❌ Not usable - Platform websites are accessible, but deployed instances cannot be reached from China due to the DNS issue.

### Summary

TinaCMS is generally available and usable in mainland China. The main obstacle is the **inaccessibility of static site hosting platforms**, and there are no direct Chinese alternatives to these services. Therefore, Chinese users can deploy their projects to *Alibaba Cloud servers* combined with *GitHub Actions* as an alternative solution.
