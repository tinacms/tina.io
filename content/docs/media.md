**Media** in Tina refers to a set of APIs to allow packages to interact with a central store of files.

## Media Store

A **Media Store** handles media files for the CMS. Media Stores provide a set of functions to specify how media should be sourced, deleted, and saved, among other things.

> ### Supported Media Stores
>
> * [`GithubMediaStore`](/packages/react-tinacms-github): Saves and sources media to/from your Git repository through the GitHub API.
> * [`NextGithubMediaStore`](/packages/next-tinacms-github#nextgithubmediastore): Configures media sourced from GitHub specifically for Next.js projects.
> * [`StrapiMediaStore`](/packages/react-tinacms-strapi/): Handles media stored in a Strapi instance.
> * [`GitMediaStore`](/guides/nextjs/git/adding-backend): Saves media to your Git repository by writing to the local system and commiting directly.

### Creating a Media Store

While there are a few media stores provided by Tina packages, you can create your own media store by implementing the `MediaStore` interface:

```typescript
interface MediaStore {
  accept: string
  persist(files: MediaUploadOptions[]): Promise<Media[]>
  previewSrc(
    src: string,
    fieldPath?: string,
    formValues?: any
  ): Promise<string> | string
  list(options?: MediaListOptions): Promise<MediaList>
  delete(media: Media): Promise<void>
}

interface Media {
  type: 'file' | 'dir'
  id: string
  directory: string
  filename: string
  previewSrc?: string
}

interface MediaList {
  items: Media[]
  limit: number
  offset: number
  nextOffset?: number
  totalCount: number
}

interface MediaUploadOptions {
  directory: string
  file: File
}

interface MediaListOptions {
  directory?: string
  limit?: number
  offset?: number
}
```

#### Media Store

| Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `accept` | The [input accept string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/file#accept) that describes what kind of files the Media Store will accept. |
| `persist` | Uploads a set of files to the Media Store and returns a Promise containing the Media objects for those files. |
| `previewSrc` | Given a `src` string, it returns a url for previewing that content. This is helpful in cases where the file may not be available in production yet. |
| `list` | Lists all media in a specific directory. Used in the media manager. |
| `delete` | Deletes a media object from the store. |

#### Media

This represents an individual file in the `MediaStore`.

| Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `type` | Indicates whether the object represents a file or a directory. |
| `id` | A unique identifier for the media item. |
| `directory` | The path to the file in the store. e.g. `public/images` |
| `filename` | The name of the file. e.g.`boat.jpg` |
| `previewSrc` | _Optional:_ A url that provides an image preview of the file. |

#### Media List

This represents a paginated query to the `MediaStore` and its results.

| Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `items` | An array of `Media` objects. |
| `limit` | The number of records returned by the current query. |
| `offset` | A number representing the beginning of the current record set. |
| `nextOffset` | _Optional:_ A number representing the beginning of the next set of records. |
| `totalCount` | The total number of records available. |

#### Media Upload Options

| Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `directory` | The directory where the file should be uploaded. |
| `file` | The [File](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File) to be uploaded. |

#### Media List Options

| Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `directory` | _Optional:_ The current directory to list media from. |
| `limit` | _Optional:_ The number of records that should be returned. |
| `offset` | _Optional:_ A number representing how far into the list the store should begin returning records from. |

### Adding a Media Store

Add the media store by assigning it to `cms.media.store` in a context where you have access to the CMS object.

```javascript
import { MyMediaStore } from './my-media-store'

cms.media.store = new MyMediaStore()
```

Or you can define it in the [CMS config](/docs/getting-started/cms-set-up/#configure-the-cms-object) object:

```js
import { TinaCMS } from 'tinacms'
import { MyMediaStore } from './my-media-store'

const cms = new TinaCMS({
  media: new MyMediaStore()
})
```

### Extending a Media Store

There may be times when you want to adjust or customize the functionality of a particular media store. For example, with `GitMediaStore`, you may want to override the `previewSrc` function to specify exactly how the image previews in the media manager list should be sourced.

**Override a method on an extended media store**

```js
import { GitMediaStore } from '@tinacms/git-client'

export class MyGitMediaStore extends GitMediaStore {
  previewSrc(src) {
    return /jpg|jpeg|png|svg|gif$/.test(src.toLowerCase())
      ? src.replace('/public', '')
      : null
  }
}
```

**Add the new media store to your app**

```js
const client = new GitClient('http://localhost:3000/___tina')

this.cms = new TinaCMS({
  enabled: process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production',
  toolbar: true,
  sidebar: {
    position: 'overlay',
  },
  apis: {
    git: client,
  },
  media: new MyGitMediaStore(client),
})
```

This is exactly how the [`NextGithubMediaStore`](https://github.com/tinacms/tinacms/blob/master/packages/next-tinacms-github/src/next-github-media-store.ts) works â€” it extends `GithubMediaStore` to customize the functions specifically for Next.js project configuration.

## Media Manager

![tinacms-media-manager](/img/media-manager-ui.png)

The media manager is an interface for interacting with a media store. It lists all the available files and directories in the store.

### Using the Media Manager

The media manager is opened when a user clicks on an image field. It is also registered as a [screen plugin](/docs/plugins/screens/#name-icon--component) and can be accessed via the global menu. When entering the media manager from an image field, editors can select or upload an image to _insert_ into the field. When entering from the global menu, editors can delete media files.

### Programmatic Access

If needed, you can open the media manager by calling `cms.media.open`:

```ts
import { useCMS } from 'tinacms'

const OpenMediaManagerButton = () => {
  const cms = useCMS()
  return (
    <button
      type="button"
      onClick={() => {
        cms.media.open()
      }}
    >
      Open Media Manager
    </button>
  )
}
```

You can optionally specify a `directory` that the media manager will open to, as well as an `onSelect` function that can do something with a media object when the user clicks the **Insert** button (an **Insert** button will not appear next to eligible media items when an `onSelect` function is not specified.)

```ts
cms.media.open({
  directory: '/uploads',
  onSelect: media => {
    console.log(`Selected ${media.id}`)
  },
})
```
