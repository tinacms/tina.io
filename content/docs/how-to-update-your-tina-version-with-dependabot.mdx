If you're using GitHub, Dependabot can automatically keep your TinaCMS packages up-to-date by checking for new versions and opening PRs.

## Configuring Dependabot

You have 2 packages to keep an eye out for:

* `tinacms`
* `@tinacms/cli`

To do that, just create a dependabot.yml file in your .github folder like this:

```yaml
# .github/dependabot.yml

version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "npm"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "daily"
    allow:
      - dependency-name: "tinacms"
      - dependency-name: "@tinacms*"
```

> Note: You can find more information about the dependabot config here: [Dependabot options reference](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/working-with-dependabot/dependabot-options-reference#about-the-dependabotyml-file)

By doing this, dependabot will create Pull Requests whenever one package is to be updated.

## How to manage the Pull Requests

Now that you have your PRs you have 2 options

### Individual PRs

By default, dependabot opens a separate PR for each package.

As both TinaCMS packages depend on eachother this will lead to conflicts and potential mistakes when merging the PRs one by one.

### Grouped PRs (recommended)

You can go the extra mile and updated your dependabot.yml config file to group Tina packages together in the same PR.

Add this at the end:

```yaml
    #.github/dependabot.yml

    # ...
    groups:
      tinacms:
        patterns:
          - "@tinacms/*"
          - "tinacms"
```

By doing this you packages will be in sync and updating your TinaCMS version will be easier!
