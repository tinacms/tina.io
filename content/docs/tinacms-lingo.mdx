## TinaCMS Editing Terminology

As TinaCMS continues to evolve, it's important to use clear and consistent language when describing its editing experience. We often reference a set of terms that explain how visual editing works and how editors interact with content. The following definitions outline these terms and show how they fit together:

**Visual Editing**\
The overall two-pane editing experience, with the **Editor** on the left and a live **Site Preview** on the right.

**TinaCMS Editor**\
The left-hand pane where content is edited using structured fields and inputs.

**Site Preview**\
The right-hand pane that displays a live view of the website as content is edited.

**Visual Element Highlighting**\
Hovering over elements in the **Site Preview** highlights them in blue 🟦, helping identify page structure and content relationships.

**Intelligent Selection**\
A feature that links the **Editor** and **Site Preview.** Clicking an item on either side automatically highlights the corresponding element on the other side in orange 🟧.
