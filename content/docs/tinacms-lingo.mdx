## TinaCMS Editing Terminology

As TinaCMS continues to evolve, it's important to use clear and consistent language when describing its editing experience. We often reference a set of terms that explain how visual editing works and how editors interact with content. The following definitions outline these terms and show how they fit together:

### Admin Sidebar

The Sidebar with collections listed (Not to be confused with the TinaCMS Editor)

### TinaCMS Editor

The left-hand pane where content is edited using structured fields and inputs.

### Visual Editing

The overall two-pane editing experience, with the **Editor** on the left and a live **Site Preview** on the right.

### Site Preview

The right-hand pane that displays a live view of the website as content is edited.

### Visual Element Highlighting

Hovering over elements in the **Site Preview** highlights them in blue 🟦, helping identify page structure and content relationships.

### Fields

[Fields](https://tina.io/docs/reference/fields) define the structure of the content served to your site. These are defined in your config, or in seperate `Template`'s.

```ts
const someTemplate: Template = {
  name: 'someTemplate',
  label: 'Some Template',
  fields: [
    { name: 'title', label: 'Title', type: 'string' }
   ]}
```

### Rich Text Embed

Within [rich-text fields](/docs/reference/types/rich-text), we have the option to embed custom components as a template. Enriching markdown backed content with React components.

```
const someCollection: Collection = {
  name: 'someCollection',
  label: 'Some Collection',
  path: 'content/someCollection',
  format: 'mdx',
  fields: [
    {
    name: 'richBody',
    label: 'Rich Body',
    type: 'rich-text',
    templates: [
      someTemplate
      ]}
     ]
    }
```

### Blocks

[Blocks](/docs/editing/blocks) are a way to model flexible page-builder styled content. It is an ordered array of different components (sections), such as a hero, features, content etc.

### Editorial Workflow

The [editorial workflow](/editorial-workflow) allows users to easily make changes in TinaCMS for a Git based environment. It gives users the ability to:

* Create branches in the TinaCMS Editor
* Make Git commits from their own site
* Create pull-requests in the TinaCMS Editor
