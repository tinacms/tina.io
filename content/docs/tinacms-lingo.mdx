## TinaCMS Editing Terminology

As TinaCMS continues to evolve, it's important to use clear and consistent language when describing its editing experience. We often reference a set of terms that explain how visual editing works and how editors interact with content. The following definitions outline these terms and show how they fit together:

### Admin Sidebar
The Sidebar with collections listed (Not to be confused with the TinaCMS Editor)

### TinaCMS Editor
The left-hand pane where content is edited using structured fields and inputs.

### Visual Editing
The overall two-pane editing experience, with the **Editor** on the left and a live **Site Preview** on the right.

### Site Preview
The right-hand pane that displays a live view of the website as content is edited.

### Visual Element Highlighting
Hovering over elements in the **Site Preview** highlights them in blue 🟦, helping identify page structure and content relationships.

### Fields
Something that is editable in TinaCMS, defined in the config. Can come in many different shapes and sizes.

### Rich Text Embed 
The “Embeds/Templates” inside Rich Text Fields.

### Blocks 
An Object Field using templates.
