## Community support

TinaCMS's front-end is offered as free and open-source. Support is provided via our [Community Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/zumN63Ybpf) (Please use the #help channel). Bugs/feature-requests can be filed directly in the [TinaCMS GitHub repo](https://github.com/tinacms/tinacms/issues/new/choose).

## Priorized Support

The Tina team provides prioritized Discord support to individuals on a paid plan. To link your Discord account to your Tina Cloud account, you can click "verify" under the `#âœ…-verify` channel in the [TinaCMS Discord](https://discord.com/invite/zumN63Ybpf). 

If your Tina Cloud email is different than your Discord account, click the 'User another email' button and verify your Tina Cloud email.
