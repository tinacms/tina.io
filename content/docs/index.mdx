TinaCMS is an open-source, Git-backed headless content management system (CMS) â€“ it allows you to craft a no-code editing experience on top of your website.

Tina doesn't lock you into a proprietary database. You control your content in the form of Markdown, MDX, and JSON files stored with the power of Git.

Continue on for a quick **2 minute rundown of TinaCMS**, and how it fits in your website.
