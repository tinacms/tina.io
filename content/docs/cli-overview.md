## Common options

Here are some common options that can be used in both `tinacms dev` and `tiancms build`
| Argument | Description |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-c` | `-c` allows you to optionally run a command as a child process. For example, you could run your Next.js project alongside the graphQL server `yarn tinacms dev -c next dev`. |
| `--port <port>` | Specify a port to run the server on. (default 4001) |
| `--datalayer-port <port>` | Specify a port to run the local level server. (default 9000) |
| `--noWatch` | Don't regenerate config on file changes. This option is good to add when building in CI or if you do not want to watch the file system for changes. |
| `--noSDK` | Don't generate the generated client SDK. [Read here](/docs/graphql/client/) for more details about the SDK. |
| `-v`,`--verbose` | increase verbosity of logged output (default: false) |
| `--rootPath` | Specify the root directory to run the CLI from (defaults to current working directory) |
|`--noTelemetry`| don't report anonyymous telemetry |

## Basic Usage:

### "tinacms dev"

> To run this command, you must have a valid `tina/config.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}` file.

`dev` will compile the schema into static files, generate typescript types for use in your project and start a graphQL server on http://localhost:4001

This command takes the arguments listed in [the common options](#common-options)

#### NextJS Example:

```bash
tinacms dev -c \"next dev\"
```

#### Other SSG Frameworks Example

```bash
tinacms dev -c \"<Yor Dev Command>\"
```

### "tinacms build"

This command compiles and validates the schema and generates the client and types. It will also ensure your content has finished indexing.

#### Options

This command takes all the common [options](#common-options) as well as a few others:

| Argument                 | Description                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------ |---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `--tina-graphql-version` | Specify the version of `@tinacms/graphql` that the backend will use. (Only needed in advanced cases)                            |
| `--local`                | Will start the local Graphql server and generate the local client. This is usefull for static builds but will not work with SSR |
| `--skip-cloud-checks`    | Skip the tina cloud checks (dangerous and not recommended)                                                                      |
| `--skip-search-indexing` | Skip the search indexing                                                                                                        |

#### Examples:

**Building for production with Tina Cloud for data fetching**

```bash
tinacms build && next build
```

**Building for production with a SSG**

```bash
tinacms build && <Your SSG build command>
```

**Using the local client and local graphql server**

```bash
tinacms build --local -c "next build"
```

This will

* Start the local graphql server
* Generate the local TinaCMS client that will query the local file system
* Produce local image paths
* build production SPA
* run Next build

### "npx @tinacms/cli@latest init"

> The init command must be run inside of an existing project (E.g a NextJS project, Hugo, Jekyll, etc).

```bash,copy
npx @tinacms/cli init
```

This will:

* Install all required dependencies for Tina.
* Define a basic content schema in the `tina` directory.
* Create example content in the demo directory.
* Edit the `package.json` to have the `dev`, `build`, and `start` scripts run the tina GraphQL API.

#### Options

| Argument        | Description                    |
| --------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `--noTelemetry` | Disables Open Source Telemetry |

### "tinacms audit"

The `audit` command is used for checking for errors in your in your files. It currently does two things.

* Checks to see if the files have the correct extension
* Submits each file as a Graphql mutation and checks for Graphql errors

By default the mutation will not change the content of the files.

#### Options

| Argument         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--clean`        | When this flag is used, it submits actual Graphql mutations to the file system. This means that it will clean out any fields that are not defined in your schema. It is a good practice to do a `git commit` before doing this so unintended changes can be easily undone. |
| `-v`,`--verbose` | increase verbosity of logged output (default: false)                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

### "tinacms search-index"

This command builds the search-index using the content in your repository and uploads it to Tina Cloud.
