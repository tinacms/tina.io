## Try it out

The generated GraphQL client has two main functionalities,

1. Generates Graphql fragments and queries that are written for you.
2. Generates a Graphql client that can be used server-side (in getStaticProps)

[See the readme for more information](https://github.com/tinacms/tinacms/blob/main/packages/%40tinacms/cli/GeneratedClientDocs.md)
