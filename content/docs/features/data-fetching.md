## Introduction

With Tina, your content is stored in Git along with your codebase. Tina provides a content API in front of your repo-based content, so that you can interact with your files as if they're in a database.

You can:

- Query content for a given collection
- Add filters, sort parameters. paginate, etc
- Query your content based on relational fields.

To interface with the API, you can use Tina's type-safe client for data-fetching, or you can manually write your own GraphQL queries and hit the API yourself.

## Making requests with the Tina Client

The Tina client is the easiest way to fetch your site's content. The client can be configured in `.tina/client.<js|ts>`.

Tina client provides a type-safe query builder, that is auto-generated based on your site's schema:

```js
import { client } from '../pathToTina/.tina/client'

const myPost = await client.queries.post({ relativePath: 'HelloWorld.md' })

console.log(myPost.title)
```

The above `client.queries.post` query is not built-in to Tina's API. This is an example of a query based on YOUR defined schema, (where you have a "post" collection defined).

From the post-list page, you can fetch the list of posts like so:

```js
const postsResponse = await client.queries.postConnection()
const posts = postResponse.data.postConnection.edges.map(x => {
  return { slug: x.node._sys.filename }
})
// This would return an array like: [ { slug: 'HelloWorld.md'}, /*...*/ ]
```

Here's an example of how the data-fetching for a basic "post" ties together with the content modelling (defined in `schema.ts`).

> For more information on manually writing queries for your specific schema, check out our ["Using the GraphQL API"](/docs/graphql/overview/) docs.

## The Local Filesystem-based Content API

When developing locally, it's often beneficial to talk to the content on your local file-system, rather than talk to the hosted content API. Tina provides a CLI tool that gets run locally next to your site. This allows all of your content to be made available through an expressive GraphQL API.

> If you setup Tina via `@tinacms/cli init`, or used one of our starters, this should be setup by default, but you can read about the CLI [here](/docs/graphql/cli/).

## Summary

- Tina provides a GraphQL API for querying your git-based content.
- Tina provides a client that allows your to make type-safe requests to the API.
- The client's "queries" property is generated based on YOUR schem.
