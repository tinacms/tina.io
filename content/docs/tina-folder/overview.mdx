## Overview

The `tina` folder is where the configuration, schema and UI customization for TinaCMS is located.

The `tina` folder is normally at the root of the repo (unless a [mono repo setup](/docs/tina-cloud/faq/#does-tina-cloud-work-with-monorepos) is being used). It has the following folder structure:

- `config.{ts,tsx,js}`
- `queries` folder (_optional_)
- `__generated___` folder
  - `_graphql.json`
  - `_lookup.json`
  - `_schema.json`
  - `frags.gql`
  - `queries.gql`
  - `schema.gql`
- `tina-lock.json`

## `Config.{ts,tsx,js}`

This file contains the [definition for the project's schema](/docs/schema), as well as the Tina configuration object. The schema must be the default export of this file.

See our ["TinaCloud Starter"](https://github.com/tinacms/tina-cloud-starter/blob/main/tina/config.ts) for an example of how this file is used. The default export of the file must be `defineConfig({})`.

```ts
import { defineConfig } from 'tinacms'

export default defineConfig({
  schema: schema,
  // ...
})
```

> For help defining the Tina schema, see our [content modelling documentation](/docs/schema/)

## `queries` folder (_optional_)

The `queries` folder is optional and is used by the [experimental generated client](/docs/data-fetching/overview/). The queries that are defined in this folder will automatically be attached to the generated client when it is built.

## `tina-lock.json`

This is where the compiled schema info is stored. This file **must be checked into source control and pushed to GitHub**. The reason for this is that TinaCloud uses the compiled schema in order to resolve documents. Any time your site's schema or tina versions are updated, you will need to run `tinacms dev` locally to trigger an update to this file, and push the updated version to GitHub.

## `__generated__` folder

This is where all the files that are generated during the schema build process are stored. This directory can be ignored from git, as it is generated at build time with `tinacms build`.

### `_graphql.json`

The Graphql AST (represented in JSON).

### `_lookup.json`

This is a lookup file that is used to resolve document names.

### `_schema.json`

The Graphql Schema AST (represented in JSON).

### `types.{js,ts}`

This file is where all the types of the schema are generated. This file is for the user to use in there site if they want to use the types. It is generated on every build.

### `client.{js,ts}`

This file is where all client is generated. This client can be used on the backend and the frontend. It is very lightweight as to not bloat the bundle size. It is generated on every build. [Check out this document](/docs/data-fetching/overview/) for more information on how to use the client.

### `frags.gql`

This file contains the raw Graphql fragments that are generated and used by the [experimental generated client](/docs/data-fetching/overview/).

### `queries.gql`

This file contains the raw graphql queries that are generated and used by the [experimental generated client](/docs/data-fetching/overview/).

### `schema.gql`

This file contains the raw graphql schema.
