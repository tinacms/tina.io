The `/tina` folder is where you configure the **content models**, **datalayer** (hosting), **content repo**, **queries** and other settings important to TinaCMS.

> It normally sits at the root of your repo, but [other options](/docs/tina-cloud/dashboard/projects#path-to-tina) are available.

## File Structure

```markdown
tina/
├── config.{ts,tsx,js}
├── queries/ <!--optional-->
├── ߺߺgeneratedߺߺ/ <!--created at runtime-->
│ ├── ߺgraphql.json
│ ├── ߺlookup.json
│ ├── ߺschema.json
│ ├── frags.gql
│ ├── queries.gql
│ └── schema.gql
└── tina-lock.json <!--created at runtime-->
```

<WarningCallout
  body={<>
    The `tina-lock.json` must be **checked into source control and pushed to
    your repo**. It contains a compiled schema used to resolve content
    documents. Run `tinacms dev` locally to trigger an update to this file.
  </>}
/>

### The Config File

`config.{ts,tsx,js}` contains the [schema](/docs/schema) (**content model**), as well as the Tina configuration object. See the [config doc](/docs/reference/config) for more details.

### The Queries Folder

The `queries/` folder is optional and is used by the [client](/docs/data-fetching/overview/) for retrieving data. Most data fetching cases will be covered by queries auto-generated by TinaCMS.

Defining additional queries here will attach them to the same query object as those in `__generated__/queries.gql`.

### Generated Files

During the build process, Tina generates a number of files in `__generated__/`.

Changes made to this directory won't be persisted.
