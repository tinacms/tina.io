When you define a collection, TinaCMS gives you access to a full-page editor window to add your content.

Tina also allows for "Visual Editing" when used with React. This is a setup that allows your **website and editor window to sit side-by-side**, showing your changes in real-time.

## How does it work?

For pages to update as you edit, you'll need to re-hydrate the page data.

In React, this is done by [using the `useTina`](/docs/contextual-editing/react) hook.

> We are currently working on adding support for other frameworks such as [vue](/docs/contextual-editing/vue).
