> - Before a page can be setup with visual editing, it first needs to be using [Tina's data-fetching](/docs/features/data-fetching/).

In react, (or react based frameworks like Next.js) visual editing can be set up on a page with the `useTina` hook

Here is an example of setting up visual editing, on a NextJS-based site.

```jsx
// ...
import { useTina } from 'tinacms/dist/react'

export default function Home(props) {
  // Pass our data through the "useTina" hook to make it editable
  const { data } = useTina({
    query: props.query,
    variables: props.variables,
    data: props.data,
  })

  // Note how our page title uses "data", and not the original "props.data".
  // This ensures that the content will be updated in edit-mode as the user types
  return <h1>{data.page.title}</h1>
}

export const getStaticProps = async () => {
  const pageResponse = await client.queries.page({ relativePath: 'home.mdx' })

  return {
    props: {
      data: pageResponse.data,
      query: pageResponse.query,
      variables: pageResponse.variables,
    },
  }
}
```

## The `useTina` hook:

`useTina` is used to make a piece of Tina content contextually editable. It is code-split, so that in production, this hook will simply pass through its data value. In edit-mode, it registers an editable form in the sidebar, and contextually updates its value as the user types.

`useTina` takes in a parameter with a few keys:

- `query` and `variables`: These are the same values that you would use for the [backend data-fetching](/docs/features/data-fetching/).
- `data`: This is the production value that gets passed through to the response unchanged in production.

> Note: Only queries for individual documents can be used with `useTina`

After a page is setup with the `useTina` hook, you can add a [router to your collection](/docs/contextual-editing/router) so that you can access contextual-editing from the CMS.

## Click to Edit (Experimental)

Tina's "click to edit" feature allows editors to select the element they want to edit on the page in order to see it in the sidebar.

In order for this to work, Tina needs to know what document and field the
element is associated with. Tina makes this easy with the `tinaField` helper
function. Using this function, developers can add the appropriate metadata
to the `[data-tina-field]` attribute.

```jsx
import { useTina, tinaField } from 'tinacms/dist/react'

const Page = (props) => {
  const { data } = useTina(props)
  return (
    <div>
      <h1 data-tina-field={tinaField(data, 'title')}>{data.title}</h1>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Now, when you open the Tina sidebar you'll see editing overlays on any element
that's been configured.
