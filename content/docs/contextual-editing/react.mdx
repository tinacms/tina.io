When you define a collection, TinaCMS gives you access to a full-page editor window to add your content.

Tina also allows for "Visual Editing" when used with React. This is a setup that allows your **website and editor window to sit side-by-side**, showing your changes in real-time.

    **Visual Editing Requirements** – before a page can be setup with visual
    editing, it first needs to be using [Tina's
    data-fetching](/docs/features/data-fetching/).

## Usage

For pages to update as you edit, you'll need to re-hydrate the page data. In React, (or react based frameworks like NextJS) you can configure a page for Visual Editing with the `useTina` hook.

This hook can be associated to content areas in your code, and registers the corresponding fields in your sidebar and for re-hydration.

In production, this hook will only pass through its initial data value.

`useTina` should be provided three parameters:

* `query` and `variables`: These are the same values that you used for [backend data-fetching](/docs/features/data-fetching/). The query must be for an **individual document only**.
* `data`: This is the GraphQL response you received from the Tina API.

> If you used the Tina client functions for data fetching, the three return values can be plugged directly into the `useTina` hook.

## Examples

### Visual Editing for NextJS

```jsx
// ...
import { useTina } from 'tinacms/dist/react';

export default function Home(props) {
  // Pass our data through the "useTina" hook to make it editable
  const { data } = useTina({
    query: props.query,
    variables: props.variables,
    data: props.data,
  });

  // Note how our page title uses "data", and not the original "props.data".
  // This ensures that the content will be updated in edit-mode as the user types
  return <h1>{data.page.title}</h1>;
}

export const getStaticProps = async () => {
  const pageResponse = await client.queries.page({ relativePath: 'home.mdx' });

  return {
    props: {
      data: pageResponse.data,
      query: pageResponse.query,
      variables: pageResponse.variables,
    },
  };
};
```

### Visual Editing with a Specified Form (experimental)

Tina's experimental **Select Form By ID** feature allows developers to choose which form shows in the visual editing sidebar when multiple `useTina` hooks (or queries) exist on a page. By default, the first query requested is used to determine the form. However, by using this feature, you can ensure that a specific form — such as the one associated with a page collection rather than a global config — is used in the Tina sidebar. This can be particularly useful when working with multiple domains, where distinct sections or areas of your site require different form configurations.

#### How It Works

When initializing the `useTina` hook, you can pass an experimental callback named `experimental___selectFormByFormId()`. This callback should return a unique form identifier, which tells Tina which document’s form should be shown in visual editing.

#### Example

```typescript
export default function PageComponent(props: PageComponentProps) {
  const { data } = useTina({
    query: props.query,
    variables: props.variables,
    data: props.data,
    experimental___selectFormByFormId() {
      return `content/pages/${props.variables.relativePath}`;
    },
  });

  // ...rest of the component code
}
```

In the example above, the callback generates a form ID using the page's `relativePath`, ensuring that the appropriate form is used for editing in the sidebar.
