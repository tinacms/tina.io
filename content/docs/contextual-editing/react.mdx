<WarningCallout
  body="**Visual Editing Requirements â€“**
  before a page can be setup with visual editing, it first needs to be using [Tina's data-fetching](/docs/features/data-fetching/)."
/>

In react, (or react based frameworks like Next.js) you can configure a page for Visual Editing with the `useTina` hook.

This hook can be associated to content areas in your code, and registers the corresponding fields in your sidebar. As these fields are changes, content areas contextually update.

> In production, this hook will only pass through its initial data value.

## `useTina` Usage

`useTina` should be provided three parameters:

* `query` and `variables`: These are the same values that you would use for the [backend data-fetching](/docs/features/data-fetching/).
* `data`: This is the production value that gets passed through to the response unchanged in production.

<WarningCallout body="Only queries for individual documents can be used with `useTina`." />

After a page is setup with the `useTina` hook, you can add a [router to your collection](/docs/contextual-editing/router) so that you can access contextual-editing from the CMS.

Here is an example of setting up visual editing, on a NextJS-based site.

```jsx
// ...
import { useTina } from 'tinacms/dist/react'

export default function Home(props) {
  // Pass our data through the "useTina" hook to make it editable
  const { data } = useTina({
    query: props.query,
    variables: props.variables,
    data: props.data,
  })

  // Note how our page title uses "data", and not the original "props.data".
  // This ensures that the content will be updated in edit-mode as the user types
  return <h1>{data.page.title}</h1>
}

export const getStaticProps = async () => {
  const pageResponse = await client.queries.page({ relativePath: 'home.mdx' })

  return {
    props: {
      data: pageResponse.data,
      query: pageResponse.query,
      variables: pageResponse.variables,
    },
  }
}
```
