Out of the box, once you define a new collection in Tina, its content becomes available through the "basic editor".

Tina also allows for "Visual Editing" so that editors can see their pages being updated in real-time as they make changes

## Adding contextual-editing to a page

To add visual editing to a page, you'll need to hydrate the pages data. In React, this is done by [using the `useTina`](/docs/contextual-editing/react) hook. We are currently working on adding support for other frameworks such as [vue](/docs/contextual-editing/vue).
