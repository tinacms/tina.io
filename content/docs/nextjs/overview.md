This guide will show you how to set up Tina in a NextJS environment. Since NextJS is a relatively open-ended framework and there are many different ways to build with it, these docs will attempt merely to give you an overview of what is required to get Tina working in a NextJS environment and provide some suggestions. The ultimate implementation will depend on your content strategy.

Unlike Gatsby, NextJS does not currently have a plugin system, so a small amount of manual bootstrapping will need to be done. Refer to the guides on [bootstrapping](/docs/nextjs/bootstrapping) and [adding a backend](/docs/nextjs/adding-backends) for information on how to set things up.
