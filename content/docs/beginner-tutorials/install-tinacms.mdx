Now we're ready to start adding in Tina!

1. From your project directory, install Tina by running `npx @tinacms/cli@latest init`.
2. Select NextJS as the framework.
3. Choose NPM as your package manager.
4. "Yes" to TypeScript.
5. Grab a coffee while TinaCMS is added to your website ‚òï.
6. *ü™ü **Windows only** ‚Äì *update your dev script in `package.json` file to tinacms dev -c  \\"next dev\\"".
7. Run `npm run dev` to start your new **Tinafied** NextJS app!![](/img/tutorials/SCR-20250319-jkaq.png)
8. Access your new Tina editor by going to `http://localhost:3000/admin/index.html`

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **DELETE** the `src/pages/` directory, this is generated to ensure compatibility with older versions.

Since you just set up TinaCMS, you might notice there's no content to edit yet. This is because Tina needs knowledge of a model to determines what data your pages need! We'll add that in the next step.
