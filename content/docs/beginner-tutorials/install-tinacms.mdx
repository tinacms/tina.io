> We have specialised [Starter Kits](/docs/introduction/using-starter) to get up and running even more quickly, but here we'll go over adding the CMS to an existing project.

Now we're ready to start adding in Tina!

### Install TinaCMS

From your project directory, install Tina by running…

```bash
npx @tinacms/cli@latest init
```

1. Select NextJS as the framework.
2. Choose NPM as your package manager.
3. "Yes" to TypeScript.

*Grab a coffee while TinaCMS is added to your website ☕.*

> 🪟 **Windows only** – update your dev script in `package.json` file to `"tinacms dev -c  \"next dev\""`.

### Test the Application

1. Run `npm run dev` to start your new **Tinafied** NextJS app!![](/img/tutorials/SCR-20250319-jkaq.png)
2. Access your new Tina editor by going to `http://localhost:3000/admin/index.html`

<WarningCallout
  body={<>
    **DELETE** the `src/pages/` directory, this is generated to ensure compatibility with older versions.
  </>}
/>

Since you just set up TinaCMS, you might notice there's no content to edit yet. This is because Tina needs knowledge of a model to determines what data your pages need! We'll add that in the next step.
