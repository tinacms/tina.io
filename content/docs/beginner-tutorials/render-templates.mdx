Now we've done most of the plumbing, the last step is to have our `awesome-content.tsx` component render out the blocks to our view.

> Remember... the power of blocks is how it enables non-developers to dictate the order in which the content is displayed on the page, so we can't just hard-code things any more.

1\. Navigate to `awesome-content.tsx` and make the following changes:

```typescript
  const awesomeTitle = pageData.data.my_first_collection.title;
  const incredibleBody = pageData.data.my_first_collection.body;
  const beautifulImage = pageData.data.my_first_collection.beautifulImage;
  const blocks = pageData.data.my_first_collection.blocks;
  console.log(blocks); // TODO: Remove later ðŸ™ƒ
```

Instead of pulling out specific values, we are now pulling out the **array of blocks**.
To see what we're dealing with, we've added a `console.log` line into the component so we can examine the shape of the data.

To update our template, we want to:

* Iterate over the blocks
* Examine what *type* of block we are looking at
* Render the appropriate HTML for that particular block

There are a few ways we can do this, but for now we'll go with the quick-n-dirty solution.

2\. Change your `awesome-content.tsx` to the following:

```typescript

  //const awesomeTitle = pageData.data.my_first_collection.title;
  //const incredibleBody = pageData.data.my_first_collection.body;
  //const beautifulImage = pageData.data.my_first_collection.beautifulImage;
  const blocks = pageData.data.my_first_collection.blocks;
  console.log(blocks);

  return (
    <>
    {blocks?.map((block, index) => {
      switch (block.__typename) {
        case "My_first_collectionBlocksTitleBlock":
          return <h1 key={index}>{block.title}</h1>;
        case "My_first_collectionBlocksBodyBlock":
          return <TinaMarkdown key={index} content={block.body} />;
        case "My_first_collectionBlocksImageBlock":
          return <img key={index} src={block.image} />;
      }
    })}
    </>
  );
```

> The order of the `blocks` array is preserved by Tina, so it respects the order that our users selected when they were building out the content via the Visual Editor, so a simple `map` + `switch` statement is all that's needed to render the appropriate HTML snippet.

Try using the Visual Editor to re-order your templates, or even add more! You can have as many instances of each template as you like!
