**Congrats**! ðŸŽ‰

You now have a web page, complete with a title, image, and body! **BUT**! Right now our `awesome-content.tsx` component is controlling the layout of our content.

We have our Header, then our image, then our body.

What happens if you want some pages to have the image at the top? Or at the bottom?

It would be pretty neat if we could allow our users to dictate which sections a page will have, along with the order these sections should appear without needing a developer to come in and create/edit the React components.

*Let's make this possible now with the power of [Tina Template]().*

Firstly, to make these fields (title, image, body) rearrangeable, we have to change our schema. We will...

* Convert each of our fields into a [Tina Template]().
* Update the schema to use our fully sick templates
* Wire them up to our HTML!
