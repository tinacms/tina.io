We've just added a new field, but that field is just a plain old input - not the best UX for the thought-provoking blogs you'll be writing.

Let's change this field to be a **rich text editor** so you can wow your audience with *bourgeoisie* text.

Thankfully, this is a one-line change directly in our schema!

### Update the Field Type

Replace your old body field with the one below:

```typescript
{
  type: "rich-text", // bourgeoisie
  name: "body",
  label: "Body",
  isBody: true,
  required: true,
}
```

Now that's changed, go ahead and refresh your page and... 💥

Uh oh, something blew up. What happened?

We're now trying to render **markdown** content on screen. Markdown can contain all sorts of weird and wonderful content, like headings, tables, lists, etc. Our poor old `<p>` tag just doesn't cut it anymore.

Time to upgrade!
