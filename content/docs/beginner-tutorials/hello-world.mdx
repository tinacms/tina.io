We want to move our hard-coded "Hello world" greeting into Tina, so it can be accessed and edited via the Tina editor, **without needing to touch the code**.

Before we can do this, we first need to define a [Tina schema]() which will control the "shape" of the data that we will receive from Tina.

1\. Go to the `tina/config.ts` file and locate the `schema` field. It should look like this:

> This is a sample schema that's provided out-of-the-box, but we're going to build our own.

```typescript
schema: {
    collections: [
      {
        name: "post",
        label: "Posts",
        path: "content/posts",
        fields: [
          {
            type: "string",
            name: "title",
            label: "Title",
            isTitle: true,
            required: true,
          },
          {
            type: "rich-text",
            name: "body",
            label: "Body",
            isBody: true,
          },
        ],
        ui: {
          // This is an DEMO router. You can remove this to fit your site
          router: ({ document }) => `/demo/blog/${document._sys.filename}`,
        },
      },
    ],
  },
```

2\. Replace the schema with a basic entry that contains a single field for our amazing Hello World message:

```typescript
schema: {
   collections: [
     {
       name: "my_first_collection",
       label: "My first collection",
       path: "content/first",
       fields: [
         {
           type: "string",
           name: "title",
           label: "Title",
           isTitle: true,
           required: true,
         }
       ],
       // Comment this out for now. We will come back to this later!
       // ui: {
       //   // This is an DEMO router. You can remove this to fit your site
       //   router: ({ document }) => `/demo/blog/${document._sys.filename}`,
       // },
     },
   ],
 },
```

3\. Now a schema has been defined, it's time to add some data to our new CMS schema!

4\. Start your app and go to `http://localhost:3000/admin/index.html`

5\. Notice on the left, we now have a "My first collection" menu item!

6\. Click on that menu item.

7\. Click the "Add Files" button

8\. You can see the single **field** we described in our Schema - the `Title` field. Add your amazing title "Hello World!" into it.

9\. Click "Save"

> If we jump back into the code, you will see a new file has been created. Look in `content/` and you'll find a `first` folder, that contains our new markdown content! The `first` folder is what we defined in our `path` field in the schema. All content we create in the "My first collection" collection will be created in this directory.
