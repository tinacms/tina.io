1\. Navigate back to our `tina/config.ts` file.

2\. Replace the old schema with a new **object** type field to unlock the power of our templates ðŸ’ª

```typescript
collections: [
      {
        name: "my_first_collection",
        label: "My first collection",
        path: "content/first",
        fields: [
          {
            type: "object", // <--- oooohhh, fancy.
            name: "blocks",
            label: "Blocks",
            list: true,
            templates: [amazingTitleBlock, beautifulImageBlock, incredibleBodyBlock], // Templates for days!
          }
        ],
        ui: {
          router: ({ document }) => {
            if (document._sys.filename == "Hello-World") {
              return "/";
            }
          },
        },
      }
    ],
```

<WarningCallout body="**We have changed the schema of our `my_first_collection` object, but the Hello-World.md file is still using the old schema. Be aware that you can easily break your page/site if you don't update the content to match schema changes.**" />

3\. For now, let's manually open `Hello-World.md` and **delete** the contents of that file.

4\. To help us build out the React component changes, let's add some new content to our `Hello-World.md` file by opening up the Visual Editor (`http://localhost:3000/admin/index.html` and navigating to our `my_first_collection` list, and edit the `Hello-World` content through the editor.)

> Notice how the Visual Editor now has a field called **Blocks**. This is our fancy `object` field we declared in our `tina/config.ts` file. See how it gives us a magical + button. Click it!

5\. Add an amazing title, a beautiful image, and an incredible body!

6\. Examine the `Hello-World.md` file in your IDE. You'll see the shape of it has changed, and our templates/content are now all stored in front-matter.

> ðŸ’¡ TinaCMS can be configured to save content to other formats, such as JSON, which is great for this kind of data.
