In the previous step, we saw an error being thrown from our implementation.

This is because the `useTina` callback is being called before `fetchContent` has completed... and it's all being done client side!

To fix this, we need to alter our approach a little, so that the `useTina` method is called once our async data fetching is complete.

We will do this by creating a new child component, and only render that component when we have some data (a typical React solution to asynchronous data fetching).

1\. Create a new component next to `page.tsx` - `awesome-content.tsx`

2\. Add the following code to it:

```typescript
"use client";
import { useTina } from "tinacms/dist/react";

export default function AwesomeContent({data}) {
  const pageData = useTina({
    data: data.data,
    query: data.query,
    variables: data.variables,
  });

  const amazingTitle = pageData.data.my_first_collection.title;

  return (
    <>
    <h1>{amazingTitle}</h1>
    </>
  );
}
```

3\. Refactor the `page.tsx` to conditionally display `<AwesomeContent />` only when we have data:

```typescript
"use client";
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import { client } from "../tina/__generated__/client";
import AwesomeContent from "./awesome-content";

export default function Home() {

  const[graphQLresponse, setGraphQLresponse] = useState<any>();

  useEffect(() => {
    // stupid React bullshit to call an async method in useEffect
    const fetchContent = async () => {
      const result = await client.queries.my_first_collection({
        relativePath: "Hello-World.md",
      });
      setGraphQLresponse(result);
    };

    fetchContent();
    
  }, []);

  return (
    <div className="grid grid-rows-[20px_1fr_20px] items-center justify-items-center min-h-screen p-8 pb-20 gap-16 sm:p-20 font-[family-name:var(--font-geist-sans)]">
      <main className="flex flex-col gap-8 row-start-2 items-center sm:items-start">
        {!graphQLresponse && <p>Loading...</p>}
        {graphQLresponse && <AwesomeContent data={graphQLresponse} />}
      </main>
    </div>
  );
}
```

That's it!

Now let's check that it works!

4\. Navigate to `http://localhost/admin/index.html` and edit your amazing title and see how the changes are immediately reflected in the HTML.

5\. Click "Save", and navigate back to `http://localhost:3000` to see your changes persisted on your "production" site.

> Bonus: check your `Hello-World.md` file in your IDE to see how the underlying content has been saved with your new changes.
