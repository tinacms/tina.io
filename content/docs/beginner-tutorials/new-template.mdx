1\. Create an `app/amazing-header/` folder

2\. Add an `amazing-header.template.tsx` file in that folder

3\. Add the following code to the `amazing-header.template.tsx` file:

> 💡 The name of the file is arbitrary, but the Tina team use (and recommend) the `.template.tsx` suffix for clarity.

```typescript
import { Template } from "tinacms";

export const amazingTitleBlock: Template = {
    name: 'titleBlock',
    label: 'Amazing title',
    fields: [
      {
        type: 'string',
        label: 'Title',
        name: 'title',
      }
    ],
  }
```

Our block is pretty basic right now - we only have 1 field. But you can see how, in a real-world application, defining many fields in a block would be super useful!

**Think of a Hero banner, which would want a background image, a CTA, and perhaps even a button link.**

4\. Now repeat this for the beautiful image and the incredible body!

You should end up with something like this:

```
src/
├── app/
│   ├── amazing-header/
│   │   ├── amazing-header.template.tsx
│   ├── beautiful-image/
│   │   ├── beautiful-image.template.tsx
│   ├── incredible-body/
│   │   ├── incredible-body.template.tsx
│   ├── ...etc.
```
