Without too much setup, our project is now the bare boned version of a fully fledged website builder service such as **Wordpress** or **Wix**.

The only difference is you have control over your data, the application and the scope of what's possible.

If you're an AI believer, add in block components from tools such as [21st.dev](https://21st.dev?tab=components\&sort=recommended) or [v0](https://v0.dev/). Or stick with the classics and build a fully modular website with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).

We're a small but dedicated dev team – if you need any support, reach out [on discord](https://discord.com/invite/zumN63Ybpf) or book a demo from the nav-bar above.
