Let's fix up our Markdown content.

1\. Update the `awesome-content.tsx` and add the following:

```typescript
import { TinaMarkdown } from "tinacms/dist/rich-text";

...

<h1>{amazingTitle}</h1>
<TinaMarkdown content={incredibleBody} />

```

Test it. It works! Now try and edit your content again. Look, a rich-text editor!

2\. Go ahead and add **some** *styling* to your body.

> ðŸ’¡ *Why did we need to do this?* When we ask TinaCMS for our Markdown content back it gives us a parsed [abstract syntax tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree) (AST). This looks like a big JavaScript object that contains our text / formatting / structure each in it's own node. \

> Tina can handle this for us using TinaMarkdown as above, or we can step through it ourselves for even more control. ðŸ”§
