Let's fix up our Markdown content.

1\. Update `app/awesome-content.tsx` and add the following:

```typescript
import { TinaMarkdown } from "tinacms/dist/rich-text";

...

<h1>{amazingTitle}</h1>
<TinaMarkdown content={incredibleBody} />

```

Test it. It works! Now try and edit your content again. Look, a rich-text editor!

2\. Go ahead and add **some** *styling* to your body.

> *Why did we need to do this?* When we ask TinaCMS for our Markdown content it gives us a parsed [abstract syntax tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree) (AST). This looks like a big JavaScript object that contains our text / formatting / structure each in it's own node. \
> \
> Tina can handle this for us using `TinaMarkdown` as above, or we can step through it ourselves for even more control. ðŸ”§

<WarningCallout
  body={<>
    `TinaMarkdown` needs to be called in a client component since it needs access to React hooks.
  </>}
/>
