The **Beginner Series** is the easiest way to learn about Tina.

TinaCMS is feature-rich, and leaves a lot of power up to the user on how it's configured.

There can be a learning curve as you get to grips with how it all fits together.

The tutorials in this section will guide you through the basics, to the more advanced ways to use Tina.

## What is TinaCMS?

TinaCMS is a **headless CMS** (content management system).

Basically, it's a way to manage content separately from website code.

Headless means that it exposes a content API for your code to use, allowing it to stay completely separated from your website â€“ but it also has tools to tailor the editing experience such as **Visual Editing** (live, side-by-side editing).

> Think of TinaCMS more like a tool to build a custom CMS experience, rather than your typical CMS tooling.
