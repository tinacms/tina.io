The **Tina schema defines the shape of your content**.

Tina uses a "content-modeling as code" approach.

* The schema is version-controlled
* You can test out schema changes locally, or in a branch.
* You can extend the schema in interesting ways (custom validation, custom UI fields, etc).

Specifically, the `schema` property in your [TinaCMS Config file](/docs/reference/config) determines data mapping between your content store and the editor.

Each item in the `schema.collections` array represents a different content structure.

Each of these contains an array of `fields` to control what appears in the TinaCMS editor.

```ts
```
