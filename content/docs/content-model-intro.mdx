The Tina schema defines the shape of your content. Tina uses a "content-modeling as code" approach. This has a few benefits compared to modelling through a UI:

* The schema is version-controlled
* Mutating the schema is easy, as you can test out changes locally, or in a branch.
* The developer can extend the schema in interesting ways (custom validation, custom UI fields, etc).

The content model, and all configuration code is defined in a file called `tina/config.{ts,js,tsx}` â€“ specifically via the `defineConfig` method (see example below).

The `schema` property determines data mapping between your content store and the editor.

Each item in the `schema.collections` array represents a distinct entity, which maps to certain directories of content in our site's repository. Each item contains an array of `fields` to control what appears in the TinaCMS editor.

The example below is a simple model definition following this structure.

```ts
// tina/config.{ts,js,tsx}
import { defineConfig } from 'tinacms'

export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  schema: {
    collections: [
      {
        label: 'Blog Posts',
        name: 'post',
        path: 'content/posts',
        fields: [
          {
            type: 'string',
            label: 'Title',
            name: 'title',
          },
          {
            type: 'string',
            label: 'Post Body',
            name: 'body',
            isBody: true,
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
})
```
