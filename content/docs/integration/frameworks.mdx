## Which Frameworks does Tina support?

Tina's default "basic editor" works in a wide variety of frameworks. It reads/writes file-based content (Markdown, MDX, JSON, etc).

> Tina also allows support for ["Visual Editing"](/docs/contextual-editing/overview/) so that editors can see their pages being updated in real-time as they make changes. Visual editing is currently limited to React-based frameworks (NextJS, React, etc).

## Configuring Tina with each framework

When configuring Tina, you will be prompted to provide a `publicFolder` in your tina config. Here are some default values for some common frameworks:
