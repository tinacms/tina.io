Tina's content management APIs are designed to give you an easy, flexible way to control how content is **sourced**, **modified**, and **persisted**.

## The CMS Object

The **CMS object** is the "command center" in a TinaCMS implementation. It's your main access point for controlling other parts of Tina.

## Forms

Tina's **Forms** are used to connect editing controls to content.

[Learn more about Forms](/docs/forms)

## Fields

Tina includes several **Fields** that define different editing controls that can be used in Forms. There are many included field types, and [custom field types](/docs/fields/custom-fields) are easy to create and hook in to the CMS.

## Creating Content

Because Tina is designed to provide an editing interface directly on a content-generated page, creating new content items is not as straight-forward as a traditional CMS.

## Media

Tina's unopinionated **Media Manager** lets you control how Media is handled, and gives you the option to integrate your favorite Digital Asset Manager.

## Working With External APIs

Any third-party APIs you need to interact with can be registered to the CMS object for easy access in different contexts.
