To deploy your site to production, you'll need to connect Tina to a hosted backend. This won't act as the source of truth for your data, but only to interface with your repo-based datastore.

We have created **TinaCloud** as a tailored service to work with TinaCMS, but you can also set this up with your preferred hosting provider.

TinaCloud provides:

* A hosted GraphQL endpoint for your content,
* Git integration
* User management
* [Editorial Workflow](http://localhost:3000/docs/drafts/editorial-workflow)

## Data Layer

The Data Layer contains indexes of your Markdown and JSON files, ensuring low latency when fetching content. The Data Layer is synced up with your GitHub repository to ensure the indexes represent the source of truth.![](/img/docs/tinacms-data-layer_geyrv8.png)

### Push your repository to GitHub

Make sure all the contents of your site are pushed to Github and your `tina/tina-lock.json` is up to date and pushed to Github.
