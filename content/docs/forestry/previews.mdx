Forestry allowed your editors to hit "preview", where your site would build and be viewable in a separate window.

Instead of traditional previews, Tina offers "visual editing", where changes are reflected on the site's preview in realtime.

This feature is optional, and is only available in React-based sites (Vue-support coming in the future).

For non-React based sites, your editors are still able to use TinaCMS's basic editor.
