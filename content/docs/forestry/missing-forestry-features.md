Below is a list of features that exist in Forestry, but are currently missing from TinaCMS. Each feature falls in one of the following categories:

**Support Planned**

This is a feature that we are confident will be added to TinaCMS.

**Considering Support**

We are looking into this feature, and may or may not bring it forward to TinaCMS.

**Not Considering Support**

We are relatively confident that this feature won't be built by the Tina team.
Keep in mind, TinaCMS's frontend is open source, so we are open to community additions / plugins.
