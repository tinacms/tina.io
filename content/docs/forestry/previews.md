Forestry allowed your editors to hit "preview", where your site would build and be viewable in a separate window.

Tina tackles this probably differently, and traditional previews are not available in Tina.

Instead, Tina offers "contextual editing", where changes are reflected on the site's preview in realtime. This feature is optional, and is only available in React-based sites (Vue-support coming in the future).
