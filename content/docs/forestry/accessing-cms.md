One of the main differences between Forestry.io and TinaCMS is how you access the CMS. In Forestry, you access the CMS via our hosted environment (`app.tina.io`).

In TinaCMS, the CMS frontend is hosted alongside your site (`<your-site-url>/admin`). This pattern is comparable to Forestry's "remote-admin" feature, which allows you to access the CMS from your site's URL.

By having the CMS-frontend hosted within your site, you have more felxability/control over your CMS behaviour. Write custom field components, create custom field validations, reuse your schema models, etc.
