Making changes to a site's schema in Forestry was usually done through Forestry's cloud-based dashboard (through the "front matter templates editor"). If you wanted to rename a field in your content-model, you'd need to update the files in git and then update the field in Forestry in separate commits.

The back-and-forth workflow between Forestry's dashboard and git made it hard to make changes to a Forestry site.

In Tina, you can run the Tina dashboard locally alongside your site. If you want to do a migration (E.g, renaming a field), you can test everything out locally with the CMS before pushing anything to git. When you're ready, everything get's pushed to Git together.
