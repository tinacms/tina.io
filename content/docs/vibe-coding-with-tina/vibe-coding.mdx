AI coding assistants pair exceptionally well with TinaCMS — as long as *you stay in control of the flow*. This guide shows how to work *with* your AI assistant like a pairing partner rather than handing it the wheel.

The goal: **guided generation over blind automation.**

***

## 1. Set the Stage

Set up an environment where your AI assistant can shine:

* ✅ Use an IDE with inline AI suggestions (VS Code + Copilot recommended)
* ✅ Start from a TinaCMS starter kit so the agent sees real code patterns
* ✅ Review SSW’s *Rules for AI Development* (or your org’s AI guidelines)
* ✅ Keep your dev server running so you can test output quickly

> **Tip:** AI works best when it has context. Having the template setup gives it some code to use.

***

## 2. Build in Bite-Sized Pieces

Avoid asking for “the whole project”. Instead, build in *small self-contained steps*.

If you know what you want, use something like:

> *"Please create a component that allows commenting on a blog post.
> It should use Giscus, and config settings should be stored in a global config
> file so they can be reused across all comment blocks."*

If you’re not sure what to build yet, let AI brainstorm with you:

> *“Suggest five useful blocks for a long-form article layout in TinaCMS.”*

## 3. Commit Early — Before Letting AI Go Wild

AI is fast — sometimes *too* fast. It may:

* Rename variables without updating references
* Delete “unused” code that’s actually needed
* Reformat entire files, making diff reviews painful

To stay safe:

* ✅ **Commit before applying major AI-generated edits**
* ✅ If experimenting, **create a new branch first**
* ✅ Treat AI outputs like prototypes: *easy to try, easy to revert*

This protects your momentum. If the AI derails, you reset instantly instead of untangling chaos.

## 4. Test & Iterate

Your job isn’t to accept suggestions blindly, it’s to **steer**.

* If a suggestion is close → Accept → Tweak → Refine
* If it’s off → Add more detail and regenerate
* If it forgets Tina → Remind it explicitly (“This is using TinaCMS.”)

Even debugging can be AI-assisted:

After those changes to the comment system, the block no longer renders.
Here's the error: error
What's likely causing this, and how can I fix it without removing Giscus?

## 5. When It Gets Stuck — Reset the Vibe

Sometimes AI spirals into irrelevant or repetitive suggestions.

To reset:

1. 🚫 Delete the bad attempts
2. ✍️ Write **one clean sentence** about the outcome you want

This snaps the assistant back into alignment.

***

## Final Thought

AI is not a replacement for understanding Tina — *it accelerates your intent*.\
The clearer your direction, the stronger its contribution.

**Build small. Commit often. Iterate confidently.**
