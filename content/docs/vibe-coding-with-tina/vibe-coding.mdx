AI coding assistants pair exceptionally well with TinaCMS as long as you stay in control of the flow. This guide shows how to work *with* your AI assistant like a partner rather than handing it the wheel.

***

## 1. Set the Stage

Set up an environment where your AI assistant can shine:

### 1.1 Use an IDE with AI integration

We recommend VSCode + Copilot.

### 1.2 Setup your folder structure

Start by creating an empty folder where you would like your project to be set up.

### 1.3 Start from a TinaCMS starter kit

> **Tip:** AI works best when it has context. Having the template gives it some code to model itself on. Check out [SSW's Rules to Better AI Development](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/rules-to-better-ai-development/) for more tips.

## 2. Build in Bite-Sized Pieces

Avoid asking for “the whole project”. Instead, build in *small self-contained steps*.

If you know what you want, use something like:

`"Please create a component that allows commenting on a blog post. It should use Giscus, and config settings should be stored in a global config
 file so they can be reused across all comment blocks."`

If you’re not sure what to build yet, let AI brainstorm with you:

`“Suggest five useful blocks for a long-form article layout in TinaCMS.”`

## 3. Commit Early, Before Letting AI Go Wild

AI is fast and confident, sometimes a bit too much. It may:

* Rename variables without updating references
* Delete “unused” code that’s actually needed
* Reformat entire files, making diff reviews painful

To stay safe:

* ✅ **Commit before applying major AI-generated edits**
* ✅ If experimenting, **create a new branch first**
* ✅ Treat AI outputs like prototypes: *easy to try, easy to revert*

This protects your momentum. If the AI derails, you reset instantly instead of untangling chaos.

## 4. Test & Iterate

Your job isn’t to accept suggestions blindly, it’s to **steer**.

* If a suggestion is close → Accept → Tweak → Refine
* If it’s off → Add more detail and regenerate
* If it forgets Tina → Remind it explicitly (“This is using TinaCMS.”)

Even debugging can be AI-assisted:

After those changes to the comment system, the block no longer renders.
Here's the error: error
What's likely causing this, and how can I fix it without removing Giscus?

## 5. When It Gets Stuck

Sometimes AI spirals into irrelevant or repetitive suggestions.

To reset:

1. Delete the bad attempts
2. Write **one clean sentence** about the outcome you want

This snaps the assistant back into alignment.

***

## Final Thought

AI is not a replacement for understanding Tina — *it accelerates your intent*.\
The clearer your direction, the stronger its contribution.

**Build small. Commit often. Iterate confidently.**
