If you want to get up and running quickly to see how Tina works, this is your route. You can either use a [Gatsby starter](https://github.com/tinacms/gatsby-starter-tinacms) that is preconfigured with Tina or add Tina to your [existing project](/docs/gatsby/manual-setup).

#### Prerequisites

To run all the tools required you need at least the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (8.0.0+)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) (Optional. You can still use `npm` if you want, but this is for your own sanity.)

## **Use a starter**

> There are a few awesome starters to choose from with varying styles and levels of complexity. Soon we will have a dedicated starters page; in the meantime check these out: a [basic Gatsby starter](https://github.com/tinacms/gatsby-starter-tinacms), [Tina Grande](https://github.com/tinacms/tina-starter-grande), [Brevifolia](https://github.com/kendallstrautman/brevifolia-gatsby-tinacms)

### 1. Install the Gatsby CLI

To use the starter, you will need to use the `gatsby-cli`. To install it, run the following command.

```bash
# npm
npm install -g gatsby-cli
# yarn
yarn global add gatsby-cli
```

### 2. Create a Gatsby Tina Site

Now we have `gatsby-cli` installed, we can now create a project based on the Tina starter by running:

```
gatsby new my-tina-starter https://github.com/tinacms/gatsby-starter-tinacms
```

The project is generated in a folder titled `my-tina-starter`, feel free to change or update that name.

### 3. Start the Server

Now let's start the development server to see how Tina edits our files.

```
cd my-tina-starter
npm run develop
```

Now navigate to http://localhost:8000 to check out the starter site!

### 4. Open the CMS

You will notice there's a pencil icon, this is the way you can toggle 'edit-mode' with Tina.

### 5. Make Edits

Navigate to various pages and see the different fields of editable content. Make changes and watch them live updates on the site and in your files.
