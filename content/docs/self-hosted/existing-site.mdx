If you want to self-host the Tina backend, and don't want to use our [pre-configured starter](/docs/self-hosted/starters/nextjs-vercel/), you can follow the steps below.

We offer a CLI init to quickly setup the backend on Next.js sites, or you can take the [manual setup approach](/docs/self-hosted/manual-setup/) if you're using another framework.

## Setup

If you already have Tina Setup in your project, make sure has the latest version of all tina packages.

In the terminal, run:

```bash
npx @tinacms/cli@latest init backend
```

This will set up TinaCMS (if it's not already installed) and add the backend pieces required for self-hosting.

This will prompt you to answer some questions:

### GitHub Personal Access Token

A Github Personal Access Token can be created in the [GitHub account settings](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new).

Make sure to assign it `repo` access to your new repository with Read/Write access to Contents.

### Choosing a Database Adapter

TinaCMS provides two database adapters in the init workflow: "Redis" (VercelKV) & "MongoDB". Learn more about Database Adapters [here](/docs/reference/self-hosted/database-adapter/overview/).

### What The Init Command Does

The init commands does the following:

* Sets up pages/tina/\[...routes].{ts,js} to handle TinaCMS GraphQL and auth requests
* Sets up tina/database.{ts,js} to handle the database
  * Configures the GitHub Git provider
  * Configures the database adapter
* Configures the TinaCMS Auth.js auth provider
* Installs any dependencies needed for the chosen Git provider, database adapter, and authentication provider

## After the init command

Once the init command finishes **make sure to copy the environment variables** that are printed in the terminal. You will also need to add these to your hosting provider.

Update all backend data fetching to use the new database client

```diff
-import client from '../tina/__generated__/client'
+import client from '../tina/__generated__/databaseClient'
```

Check out the [this page](/docs/self-hosted/querying-data) for more information.

After these steps are completed the `dev` and `build` commands should be ready for use
