## Overview

When using Tina Cloud, you would typically use the [TinaCMS client](/docs/data-fetching/overview/) to query your content.

```js
import { client } from '../[pathToTina]/tina/__generated__/client'

const myPost = await client.queries.blogPost({
  relativePath: 'HelloWorld.md',
})

console.log(myPost.title)
```

Under the hood, this uses the fetch api to request data from Tina Cloud.

When self-hosting, since your database content is fully scoped to your project, you're able to communicate with the database directly. We provide a separate `databaseClient` that can be used to query data from the database.

```diff
- import { client } from '../[pathToTina]/tina/__generated__/client'
+ import { client } from '../[pathToTina]/tina/__generated__/databaseClient'

// ...
```

This `databaseClient` should be used when querying data on the server. For example: `getStaticProps`, `getServerSideProps`, or using React Server Components, etc.

## How does it work?

The `databaseClient` uses the exported database in your `database.{ts,js}`. It creates a GraphQL resolver that uses the database to retrieve data from the database.

## Usage

The `databaseClient` has the same interface as the [TinaCMS client](/docs/data-fetching/overview/). This means you can use it in the same way you would use the [TinaCMS client](/docs/data-fetching/overview/).

```ts
import databaseClient from '../tina/__generated__/databaseClient'

//...
const res = await databaseClient.queries.postConnection()
```
