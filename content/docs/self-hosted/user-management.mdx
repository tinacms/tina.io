# Users Collection

When using the default self-hosted auth, logins and passwords are stored in a collection named “User”. This collection is accessible from the Collections menu in the same way as the other collections. The collection consists of a single document with a list of user objects.

> Note: The user collection is not stored in your Git repository. All changes to the collection are persisted to the self-hosted database.

# Reset Password

Click on the user. Update the password and click the Require Password Change on Next Login toggle. Click Save.

# Customizing the User Collection

The default user collection consists of the following fields:

- Username
- Name
- Email
- Password

The only required fields for a user collection are a password-type field (with `required: true`) and a string-type field marked with `uid: true, required: true` to indicate that it is a username. Additional fields can be added as needed.

```js
import { TinaUserCollection } from 'tinacms-authjs'

const config = defineStaticConfig({
  ...
  schema: {
    collections: [
      ...,
      {
        ...TinaUserCollection,
        fields: [
          ...TinaUserCollection.fields,
          // Add phone number to existing fields
          {
            type: 'string',
            label: 'Phone',
            name: 'phone'
          },
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
```
