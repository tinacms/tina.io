Currently, when running a Tina site in production, you need to connect it to [Tina Cloud](/docs/tina-cloud/) for user authentication and to handle the communication with GitHub. 

**We're strongly considering a self-hosted alternative to Tina Cloud**;  A simple backend that you can host yourself so you're not locked into Tina Cloud. We love the control and portability you get when storing content in Markdown and JSON files and want to extend that to the rest of the CMS. 

If you're interested in this, please add your vote to [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/tinacms/tinacms/discussions/3096) and describe your use case.  This helps us prioritize the work.
