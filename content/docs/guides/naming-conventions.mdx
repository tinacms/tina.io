There are two primary reasons for following naming conventions in your Tina project:

* **Improved hot reloads**: Rebuilding your schema is an expensive process and keeping your schemas in separate files prevents rebuilds making code changes
* **Improved code scanning**: It's easy to find the schema configuration for a React component when it has the same file name as the component

### Example - React components

The typical convention is to add the schema for a given React component to an accompanying file of the same name with the suffix `schema.tsx`. This ensures your index is only rebuilt when changes are made to your data model and not to the component.

```javascript
src/
├── app/
│   ├── components/
│   │   ├── events-list.schema.tsx
│   │   ├── events-list.tsx
```

### Example - Shared Fields

Code shared between multiple collections, including field definitions and lists of field definitions are also typically stored in files ending in `.schema.tsx`. In the Example below assume we are sharing the `title` field between the `hero-image` and image-text-block. Component.

```javascript
src/
├── tina/
│   ├── collections/
│   │   ├── shared-fields/
│   │   │   ├── title.schema.tsx
├── app/
│   ├── components/
│   │   ├── blocks/
│   │   │   ├── hero-image.schema.tsx
│   │   │   ├── hero-image.tsx
│   │   │   ├── image-text-block.schema.tsx
│   │   │   ├── image-text-block.tsx

```

### Naming conventions for blocks

If you're re-using the template for a block component between multiple collections it's good practice to separate that template into a file ending in `.template.tsx`.

> Note: `templates` are passed into existing collections using a [block-based editing](https://tina.io/docs/editing/blocks)

In the example below, assume we are using the `image-carousel` block template in the our block renderer. The `image-carousel` template can be shared between the `home` and `about` collections.

```javascript
src/
├── tina/
│   ├── collections/
│   │   ├── home.tsx
│   │   ├── about.tsx
├── app/
│   ├── components/
│   │   ├── blocks/
│   │   │   ├── image-carousel.tsx
│   │   │   ├── image-carousel.template.tsx
│   │   │   ├── blocks-renderer.tsx
```

| `.schema.tsx`     | Used for collections and code shared between collections                                            |
| `.template.tsx`   | Used for template definitions used for [block-based rendering](https://tina.io/docs/editing/blocks) |
