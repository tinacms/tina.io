To see which version of TinaCMS you’re currently using, check your `package.json` file:

```json
"dependencies": {
  "@tinacms/cli": "^1.x.x",
  "tinacms": "^1.x.x"
}
```

🔍 How to Find Available Versions

> Note: Always update both tinacms and @tinacms/cli to the latest version together to get the latest feature and avoid compatibility issues.

You can view all published versions of TinaCMS packages on npmjs.com:

[tinacms on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tinacms)

[@tinacms/cli on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tinacms/cli)

Use your preferred package manager to upgrade TinaCMS to the latest version e.g.

```bash
npm install tinacms @tinacms/cli@latest
```

Example of Installing a Specific Version of TinaCMS with npm:

```bash
npm install tinacms@2.8.0 @tinacms/cli@1.10.0
```

> ⚠️ Reminder: After upgrading Tina, run a dev build to ensure lock file is up to date

```bash
npm run dev
```

This ensures TinaCMS’s internal plugins and dependencies trigger any needed updates to `tina-lock.json`. This file will need to be commited so that TinaCloud knows which version of TinaCMS your site is using.
