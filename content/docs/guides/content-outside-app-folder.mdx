## Introduction

In some projects, your content files live outside the application folder where TinaCMS is installed. For example, your Next.js app might be in `packages/website/` while your markdown content is in a top-level `content/` folder.

TinaCMS supports this layout using the `localContentPath` config option. This guide walks through how to set it up.

> If your content lives in a completely **separate Git repository**, see the [Separate Content Repo](/docs/guides/separate-content-repo) guide instead.

## Example Structure

```
my-monorepo/
├── content/               ← your markdown/MDX content
│   ├── tina/              ← required (TinaCMS writes generated files here)
│   ├── pages/
│   │   └── home.mdx
│   └── posts/
│       └── hello.md
└── packages/
    └── website/           ← your Next.js app
        ├── tina/
        │   └── config.ts  ← TinaCMS config lives here
        ├── package.json
        └── ...
```

## Step 1: Configure `localContentPath`

In your `tina/config.ts`, set `localContentPath` to point at your content directory. The path is **resolved relative to the `tina/` config folder**, not the project root.

```ts
// packages/website/tina/config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'tinacms'

export default defineConfig({
  // From packages/website/tina/ → up 3 levels → into content/
  localContentPath: process.env.TINA_CONTENT_PATH || '../../../content',
  build: {
    publicFolder: 'public',
    outputFolder: 'admin',
  },
  schema: {
    collections: [
      {
        name: 'post',
        label: 'Blog Posts',
        path: 'posts',  // relative to content root, NOT the app
        fields: [
          {
            type: 'string',
            name: 'title',
            label: 'Title',
          },
          {
            type: 'rich-text',
            name: 'body',
            label: 'Body',
            isBody: true,
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
})
```

<WarningCallout
  body={<>
    Use an environment variable for `localContentPath` since the relative path may differ per developer depending on where they clone the repo.
  </>}
/>

## Step 2: Create a `tina/` Folder in the Content Directory

TinaCMS writes generated files (`tina-lock.json`, `__generated__/` etc.) into a `tina/` folder inside the content root. **This folder must exist** or the CLI will fail with:

```
Unable to find Tina folder, if you're working in folder outside of the Tina config be sure to specify --rootPath
```

Create it:

```sh
mkdir -p content/tina
```

You can add a `.gitkeep` file to ensure it's tracked by Git:

```sh
touch content/tina/.gitkeep
```

## Step 3: Set Collection Paths Relative to the Content Root

When `localContentPath` is set, collection `path` values are resolved relative to the content root — **not** the application folder.

For example, if your content lives at `content/posts/`:

```ts
// Correct - relative to content root
{
  name: 'post',
  path: 'posts',
  // ...
}

// Wrong - would look for content/content/posts/
{
  name: 'post',
  path: 'content/posts',
  // ...
}
```

## Step 4: Run the Dev Server

No special CLI flags are needed. Just run from your app directory as usual:

```sh
cd packages/website
npx tinacms dev -c "next dev"
```

You should see:

```
🦙 TinaCMS Dev Server is initializing...
Using separate content repo at /path/to/my-monorepo/content

TinaCMS Dev Server is active
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Unable to find Tina folder ... specify --rootPath"

This error means the content directory is missing a `tina/` folder. Create one with `mkdir content/tina`. The `--rootPath` suggestion in the error message is misleading for this use case — it controls where TinaCMS looks for the **app config**, not the content directory.

### Documents not found or empty collections

Check that your collection `path` values are relative to the content root, not the app folder. If `localContentPath` points to `content/`, then `path: "posts"` resolves to `content/posts/`, not `content/content/posts/`.

### Path resolution reference

`localContentPath` is resolved relative to the `tina/` config folder. Count the directory levels carefully:

```
packages/website/tina/config.ts
         ↑       ↑     ↑
         │       │     └── the file
         │       └── localContentPath resolves from here
         └── ../../../content goes: tina/ → website/ → packages/ → repo root → content/
```
