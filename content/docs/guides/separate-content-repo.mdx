## Introduction

Tina supports sourcing content from a separate Git repo. With this approach you can continue to define your
Tina config in your "website repo", but documents will be saved elsewhere.

### Why?

You might want to do this for a variety of reasons, such as:

* To decouple your website code from your content files so your commit history isn't a mix of content updates and code updates
* To avoid having to give TinaCloud write access to your website's code (only give access to your content repo)

<WarningCallout
  body={<>
    Throughout this guide we'll be referring to a "website repo" and a "content repo". The "website repo" is where your actual website is running, while the "content repo" is where you'll be storing your markdown content
  </>}
/>

### Requirements

* You must have *both* the "content repo" and the "website repo" checked out onto your local machine.
* You must provide the location of your content repo in your Tina config (more about that below).
* When making changes, you'll need to ensure you've pushed *both* repos to GitHub, with the "content repo"
  changes first

## Create the website repository

First, create a new Tina project. To help you get started we've created a basic starting "[website repo](https://github.com/tinacms/separate-website-repo)", which you can clone to follow along.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:tinacms/separate-website-repo.git
```

The "website repo" contains a NextJS site, and the `tina` config with the local config path already configured.

## Create the content repository

Next we'll setup the "content repo". Lets create a simple simple `.mdx` file to start with:

```bash
tree .
# .
# └── separate-website-repo
#
# 2 directories, 0 files

mkdir -p demo-content-repo/content/pages
cd demo-content-repo
touch ./content/pages/home.mdx 
echo "Hello" >> ./content/pages/home.mdx
cd ..

tree .
# .
# ├── demo-content-repo
# │   └── content
# │       └── pages
# │           └── home.mdx
# └── separate-website-repo
# 
# 5 directories, 1 file
```

This command creates a folder (`demo-content-repo`) and adds a single MDX file to it in the `content/pages` directory. We'll be using that directory for the `page` collection defined in the Tina config.

## Local Development

In the "website repo", install the project's dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

Run the project locally:

```bash
yarn dev
```

## Visit the page in edit mode

Open `http://localhost:3000/admin/index.html`.

From here you can add more fields to you content models in `tina/config.js`. [Visit the docs](https://tina.io/docs/schema/) to learn more about content modeling.

## Deploying your website repo in TinaCloud

Next we'll want to create a TinaCloud project for our "website repo"

1. Initialize Git in your content repo and push it to GitHub.
2. [Connect the website repo to TinaCloud](https://tina.io/docs/tinacloud/dashboard/projects/)
3. Once that's done, [create a content token](https://tina.io/docs/tinacloud/dashboard/projects/#api-tokens) for the `main` branch, or use `*` to allow all branches.

Switch back to your "website repo" and set up an `.env` file to use when connecting to TinaCloud:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

When you run `tinacms build`, it will use those credentials to connect to TinaCloud rather than the local server:

```bash
yarn build
```

## Connecting the content repo

Now that the “website repo” has been created in TinaCloud, grab the client ID for the project and create a new tina/meta.json file in the content repo.

```bash
cd demo-content-repo
mkdir tina/
touch tina/meta.json
```

Then add the following contents into tina/meta.json

```
{
  "upstreamBranch": "main",
  "upstreamClientId": "{{ client ID }}"
}
```

<WarningCallout
  body={<>
    Previous versions of TinaCMS required you to maintain an up-to-date \`/tina\` folder in both repositories. This has now been simplified to a single `tina/meta.json` file. If you're migrating from the way it used to be, ensure to update the repo in TinaCloud from the “content repo” to the “website repo”.
  </>}
/>

## Path Configuration Considerations

When defining collection paths inside your tina/config.(ts/js), avoid setting `path: ''` . As Tina expects a folder-relative path. Using an empty string `''` can result in errors when creating new documents because Tina prepends a `/` when saving, which can lead to invalid GitHub paths and creation errors.

## Static Site Generator Compatibility

If you are using a static site generator (SSG) other than Next.js, such as Astro. Ensure your content pipeline ignores the `tina/` directory inside your content repo. Tina's config files are not content files and this may cause parsing errors.

Here's an example of how to exclude the \`tina/\` directory:

```javascript
export default defineCollection({
  schema: mySchema,
  exclude: ['tina/**/*'],
});
```

## Triggering Website Builds from the Content Repo (Optional)

When using a separate content repo, you may want content updates (e.g. from TinaCMS UI) to automatically trigger a build of your website. TinaCloud supports this out of the box using webhooks.

### Using TinaCloud Webhooks (Recommended)

TinaCloud can be configured to send a POST request to a webhook endpoint whenever content changes are committed. This is the recommended way to trigger a rebuild of your website.

👉 Check out the [webhook functionality](https://tina.io/docs/tinacloud/webhooks) for more details

### Triggering Builds with GitHub Actions

As an alternative to using webhooks, you can trigger website builds with GitHub Actions.\
This is useful if your platform doesn’t support build webhooks, or if you want more control over the build process.

#### Example Workflow

Create a workflow file in your content repo (e.g. `.github/workflows/trigger-website-build.yml`):

```yaml
name: Trigger Website Build

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  push:
    branches:
      - '**'

jobs:
  trigger-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.repository_owner == 'your-org'

    steps:
      - name: Generate a token
        id: generate-token
        uses: actions/create-github-app-token@v2
        with:
          app-id: ${{ vars.MY_APP_ID }}
          private-key: ${{ secrets.MY_APP_PRIVATE_KEY }}
          owner: your-org
          repositories: your-website-repo

      - name: Trigger website deploy
        run: |
          gh workflow run build-and-deploy.yml \
            --repo your-org/your-website-repo \
            --ref main \
            --field run_id="$GITHUB_RUN_ID" \
            --field branch_name="${GITHUB_REF#refs/heads/}"
        env:
          GH_TOKEN: ${{ steps.generate-token.outputs.token }}
```

#### Prerequisites

This setup requires:

* A GitHub App with access to both repos
* Token and app secrets saved in GitHub repo settings
