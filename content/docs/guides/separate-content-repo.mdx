## Introduction

Tina supports sourcing content from a separate Git repo. With this approach you can continue to define your
Tina config in your "website repo", but documents will be saved elsewhere.

### Why?

You might want to do this for a variety of reasons, such as:

* To decouple your website code from your content files so your commit history isn't a mix of content updates and code updates
* To avoid having to give TinaCloud write access to your website's code (only give access to your content repo)

<WarningCallout
  body={<>
    Throughout this guide we'll be referring to a "website repo" and a "content repo". The "website repo" is where your actual website is running, while the "content repo" is where you'll be storing your markdown content
  </>}
/>

### Requirements

* You must have *both* the "content repo" and the "website repo" checked out onto your local machine.
* You must provide the location of your content repo in your Tina config (more about that below).
* When making changes, you'll need to ensure you've pushed *both* repos to GitHub, with the "content repo"
  changes first
* When making changes you will need to sync the generated files in `tina/` (such as `tina-lock.json`, `__generated__` files etc) between your website repo and content repo

## Create the website repository

We have deployed a basic starting "[website repo](https://github.com/tinacms/separate-website-repo)", which you can clone to get started.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:tinacms/separate-website-repo.git
```

The "website repo" contains the NextJS site, and the `tina` config.

## Create the content repository

To set up the "content repo", we'll start with a simple `.mdx` file:

```sh
mkdir -p ../demo-content-repo/content/pages && touch ../demo-content-repo/content/pages/home.mdx && echo "Hello" >> ../demo-content-repo/content/pages/home.mdx
```

This command creats a folder (`demo-content-repo`) and added a single MDX file to it in the `content/pages` directory, we'll be using that directory for the `page` collection defined in the Tina config.

## Local Development

In the "website repo", install the project's dependencies

```sh
yarn install
```

Run the project locally:

```sh
yarn dev
```

## Visit the page in edit mode

Open `http://localhost:3000/admin/index.html`.

From here you can add more fields to you content models in `tina/config.js`. [Visit the docs](https://tina.io/docs/schema/) to learn more about content modeling.

## Deploying your content repo

Next we'll want to create a TinaCloud project from our "content repo"

1. Initialize Git in your content repo and push it to GitHub.
2. From there [connect to TinaCloud](https://tina.io/docs/tina-cloud/dashboard/projects/)
3. Once that's done, [create a token](https://tina.io/docs/tina-cloud/dashboard/projects/#api-tokens) for the `main` branch, or use `*` to allow all branches.

Switch back to your "website repo" and set up an `.env` file to use when connecting to TinaCloud:

```
cp .env.example .env
```

When you run `tinacms build`, it will use those credentials to connect to TinaCloud rather than the local server:

```sh
yarn build
```

## Managing Schema Changes Across Repos

When you modify your Tina schema ( tina/config.(ts/js) )

1. Run `tinacms build` to regenerate files - Tina will regenerate files such like your `tina-lock.json`
2. Commit and push these changes to \*\*both \*\*your website repo and content repo to ensure compatibility across builds

## Path Configuration Considerations

When defining collection paths inside your tina/config.(ts/js), avoid setting \`path: '' . As Tina expects a folder-relative path. Using an empty string `''` can result in errors when creating new documents because Tina prepends a `/` when saving, which can lead to invalid GitHub paths and creation errors.

## Static Site Generator Compatibility

If you are using a static site generate (SSG) other than Next.js, such like Astro. Ensure your content pipeline ignores the `tina/` directory inside your content repo. Tina's config files are not content files and this may cause parsing errors.

Here's an example of how to exclude the \`tina/\` directory:

```javascript
export default defineCollection({
  schema: mySchema,
  exclude: ['tina/**/*'],
});
```

## Triggering Website Builds from the Content Repo (Optional)

When using a separate content repo, you may want content updates (e.g. from TinaCMS UI) to automatically trigger a build of your website. TinaCloud supports this out of the box using webhooks.

### Using TinaCloud Webhooks (Recommended)

TinaCloud can be configured to send a POST request to a webhook endpoint whenever content changes are committed. This is the recommended way to trigger a rebuild of your website.

ðŸ‘‰ Check out the [webhook functionality](https://tina.io/docs/tina-cloud/webhooks) for more details

### Triggering Builds with GitHub Actions

As an alternative to using webhooks, you can trigger website builds with GitHub Actions.\
This is useful if your platform doesnâ€™t support build webhooks, or if you want more control over the build process.

#### Example Workflow

Create a workflow file in your content repo (e.g. `.github/workflows/trigger-website-build.yml`):

```yaml
name: Trigger Website Build

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  push:
    branches:
      - '**'

jobs:
  trigger-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.repository_owner == 'your-org'

    steps:
      - name: Generate a token
        id: generate-token
        uses: actions/create-github-app-token@v2
        with:
          app-id: ${{ vars.MY_APP_ID }}
          private-key: ${{ secrets.MY_APP_PRIVATE_KEY }}
          owner: your-org
          repositories: your-website-repo

      - name: Trigger website deploy
        run: |
          gh workflow run build-and-deploy.yml \
            --repo your-org/your-website-repo \
            --ref main \
            --field run_id="$GITHUB_RUN_ID" \
            --field branch_name="${GITHUB_REF#refs/heads/}"
        env:
          GH_TOKEN: ${{ steps.generate-token.outputs.token }}
```

#### Prerequisites

This setup requires:

* A GitHub App with access to both repos
* Token and app secrets saved in GitHub repo settings
