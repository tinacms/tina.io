## Introduction

Tina supports sourcing content from a separate Git repo. With this approach you can continue to define your
Tina config in your "website repo", but documents will be saved elsewhere.

### Why?

You might want to do this for a variety of reasons, such as:

* To decouple your website code from your content files so your commit history isn't a mix of content updates and code updates
* To avoid having to give TinaCloud write access to your website's code (only give access to your content repo)
* Your project is a monorepo where the content lives outside the application folder

<WarningCallout
  body={<>
    Throughout this guide we'll be referring to a "website repo" and a "content repo". The "website repo" is where your actual website is running, while the "content repo" is where you'll be storing your markdown content
  </>}
/>

### Requirements

* You must have *both* the "content repo" and the "website repo" checked out onto your local machine.
* You must provide the location of your content repo in your Tina config (more about that below).
* The content repo **must contain a `tina/` folder** (even if empty). TinaCMS writes generated files like `tina-lock.json` into `tina/__generated__/` inside the content root.
* When making changes, you'll need to ensure you've pushed *both* repos to GitHub, with the "content repo"
  changes first
* When making changes you will need to sync the generated files in `tina/` (such as `tina-lock.json`, `__generated__` files etc) between your website repo and content repo

## Configuring `localContentPath`

The `localContentPath` config option tells TinaCMS where your content lives during local development. There are a few important details:

### Path resolution

The path is **resolved relative to the `tina/` config folder**, not the project root. For example, given this structure:

```
my-project/
├── website/
│   └── tina/
│       └── config.ts    ← localContentPath is relative to here
└── content/
    ├── tina/            ← required (can be empty)
    └── posts/
        └── hello.md
```

Your config would use:

```ts
export default defineConfig({
  // From website/tina/ → up two levels → into content/
  localContentPath: process.env.TINA_CONTENT_REPO_PATH, // e.g. '../../content'
  // ...
})
```

<WarningCallout
  body={<>
    Use an environment variable for `localContentPath` since the path may differ per developer on your team.
  </>}
/>

### The content directory must have a `tina/` folder

TinaCMS writes generated files (`tina-lock.json`, `__generated__/` etc.) into a `tina/` folder inside the content root. If this folder doesn't exist, the CLI will fail with:

```
Unable to find Tina folder, if you're working in folder outside of the Tina config be sure to specify --rootPath
```

To fix this, create the folder in your content directory:

```sh
mkdir -p my-content-repo/tina
```

### Collection paths are relative to the content root

When `localContentPath` is set, collection `path` values are resolved relative to the content root — **not** the website project root. For example, if your content lives at `my-content-repo/posts/`:

```ts
// tina/collections/post.ts
export default {
  name: "post",
  path: "posts",  // relative to the content root, NOT "my-content-repo/posts"
  // ...
}
```

## Create the website repository

We have deployed a basic starting "[website repo](https://github.com/tinacms/separate-website-repo)", which you can clone to get started.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:tinacms/separate-website-repo.git
```

The "website repo" contains the NextJS site, and the `tina` config.

## Create the content repository

To set up the "content repo", we'll start with a simple `.mdx` file:

```sh
mkdir -p ../demo-content-repo/content/pages && touch ../demo-content-repo/content/pages/home.mdx && echo "Hello" >> ../demo-content-repo/content/pages/home.mdx
```

This command creates a folder (`demo-content-repo`) and added a single MDX file to it in the `content/pages` directory, we'll be using that directory for the `page` collection defined in the Tina config.

Don't forget to create the required `tina/` folder in your content repo:

```sh
mkdir -p ../demo-content-repo/tina
```

## Local Development

In the "website repo", install the project's dependencies

```sh
yarn install
```

Run the project locally:

```sh
yarn dev
```

## Visit the page in edit mode

Open `http://localhost:3000/admin/index.html`.

From here you can add more fields to you content models in `tina/config.js`. [Visit the docs](https://tina.io/docs/schema/) to learn more about content modeling.

## Deploying your content repo

Next we'll want to create a TinaCloud project from our "content repo"

1. Initialize Git in your content repo and push it to GitHub.
2. From there [connect to TinaCloud](https://tina.io/docs/tinacloud/dashboard/projects/)
3. Once that's done, [create a token](https://tina.io/docs/tinacloud/dashboard/projects/#api-tokens) for the `main` branch, or use `*` to allow all branches.

Switch back to your "website repo" and set up an `.env` file to use when connecting to TinaCloud:

```
cp .env.example .env
```

When you run `tinacms build`, it will use those credentials to connect to TinaCloud rather than the local server:

```sh
yarn build
```

## Managing Schema Changes Across Repos

When you modify your Tina schema ( tina/config.(ts/js) )

1. Run `tinacms build` to regenerate files - Tina will regenerate files such like your `tina-lock.json`
2. Commit and push these changes to \*\*both \*\*your website repo and content repo to ensure compatibility across builds

## Path Configuration Considerations

When defining collection paths inside your tina/config.(ts/js), avoid setting \`path: '' . As Tina expects a folder-relative path. Using an empty string `''` can result in errors when creating new documents because Tina prepends a `/` when saving, which can lead to invalid GitHub paths and creation errors.

## Static Site Generator Compatibility

If you are using a static site generate (SSG) other than Next.js, such like Astro. Ensure your content pipeline ignores the `tina/` directory inside your content repo. Tina's config files are not content files and this may cause parsing errors.

Here's an example of how to exclude the \`tina/\` directory:

```javascript
export default defineCollection({
  schema: mySchema,
  exclude: ['tina/**/*'],
});
```

## Triggering Website Builds from the Content Repo (Optional)

When using a separate content repo, you may want content updates (e.g. from TinaCMS UI) to automatically trigger a build of your website. TinaCloud supports this out of the box using webhooks.

### Using TinaCloud Webhooks (Recommended)

TinaCloud can be configured to send a POST request to a webhook endpoint whenever content changes are committed. This is the recommended way to trigger a rebuild of your website.

👉 Check out the [webhook functionality](https://tina.io/docs/tinacloud/webhooks) for more details

### Triggering Builds with GitHub Actions

As an alternative to using webhooks, you can trigger website builds with GitHub Actions.\
This is useful if your platform doesn't support build webhooks, or if you want more control over the build process.

#### Example Workflow

Create a workflow file in your content repo (e.g. `.github/workflows/trigger-website-build.yml`):

```yaml
name: Trigger Website Build

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  push:
    branches:
      - '**'

jobs:
  trigger-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.repository_owner == 'your-org'

    steps:
      - name: Generate a token
        id: generate-token
        uses: actions/create-github-app-token@v2
        with:
          app-id: ${{ vars.MY_APP_ID }}
          private-key: ${{ secrets.MY_APP_PRIVATE_KEY }}
          owner: your-org
          repositories: your-website-repo

      - name: Trigger website deploy
        run: |
          gh workflow run build-and-deploy.yml \
            --repo your-org/your-website-repo \
            --ref main \
            --field run_id="$GITHUB_RUN_ID" \
            --field branch_name="${GITHUB_REF#refs/heads/}"
        env:
          GH_TOKEN: ${{ steps.generate-token.outputs.token }}
```

#### Prerequisites

This setup requires:

* A GitHub App with access to both repos
* Token and app secrets saved in GitHub repo settings
