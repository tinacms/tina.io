## Introduction

This guide is a walkthrough using a **WordPress to Markdown converter**, which is recommended for most use cases where you want to migrate your content from WordPress to Tina.

Other conversion options that are not covered in this guide include:

* Using the WordPress Rest API - best for extracting the pure html for page or post content in JSON format
* Using the WPGraphQL plugin - best for cases where you want to query and extract specific data and content

## Prerequisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is installed
* You have set up a [Tina starter](https://tina.io/docs/introduction/using-starter)

## Getting Started

### Converting WordPress to Markdown

1\. Export your Wordpress content by going to [https://wordpress.com/export/](https://wordpress.com/export/) and select **Export All**

Note: Name it export.xml to make it easier for you in the next step

2\. In the folder where **export.xml** is, run:

```powershell
npx wordpress-export-to-markdown --post-folders=false --include-other-types=true
```

3\. When prompted, make sure the filename matches the filename you used, and use the default values for the other prompts.

This uses [wordpress-export-to-markdown](https://github.com/lonekorean/wordpress-export-to-markdown) to convert your WordPress content into Markdown, and groups posts and pages as output.

4\. Navigate to your output's posts folder `output/post`, and run:

```powershell
ren * *.mdx
```

Which will convert your files from Markdown to MDX.

### Import data to TinaCMS

#### Migrating images

1\. In the output folder, drag the image folders `output/post/images` and `output/page/images` to your Tina app's `public/uploads` folder.

Note 1: You can rename the folder before dragging to prevent duplicate image names being replaced

Note 2: You can also set up alternative hosting.

#### Migrating Posts

1\. Drag all the MDX files in `output/post` to your Tina app's `content/posts` folder, now your posts have been migrated to Tina!

#### Migrating Pages

<WarningCallout body="If you are having trouble with this step, feel free to contact a developer for assistance in the chat, or through one of our community channels." />

1\. Create a new folder in your Tina app's `content` folder named `wp-pages`.

2\. Create a new file in your Tina app's `tina/collection` folder named `wp-page.ts` and use the template below, you can change this later to fit your page's schemas better.

```javascript
import type { Collection } from "tinacms";

const WpPage: Collection = {
  label: "Migrated WordPress Pages",
  name: "wppage",
  path: "content/wp-pages",
  format: "md",
  fields: [
    {
      type: "string",
      label: "Title",
      name: "title",
      isTitle: true,
      required: true,
    },
    {
      type: "rich-text",
      label: "Body",
      name: "_body",
      isBody: true,
    },
  ],
};

export default WpPage;

```

3\. Import your created WpPage to the [schema](https://tina.io/docs/reference/schema) in tina/config.tsx

```javascript

import WpPage from "./collection/wp-page";
...

schema: {
  collections: [Page, Post, ..., WpPage],
},
```

### View and Edit your migrated content

1. At the root of your Tina app, run:

```powershell
npm run dev
```

2\. Go to localhost:3000/admin

3\. Go to the Migrated WordPress Pages and Blog Posts collections, then to the Media Manager.

3. View and edit your migrated posts, pages and images!

## Next Steps

* Adding a coverImage field to your post schema to read the image
* Update the image links in the Markdown and MDX files to match how Tina uses them, uploads/image.png
* Making changes to the themes and any missing features from the exporter
* Take advantage of [npm packages](https://www.npmjs.com/) to replace WordPress plugins functionalities
