## Unable to Find Record Error

TinaCloud's GraphQL API returns this error when it cannot find a file in your GitHub repository. This may occur under the following circumstances:

* The `tina` folder (and `__generated__` subfolder) is not in your GitHub repository remote
  * If the folder is in your local repository, but not in your remote, make sure there isn't a `.gitignore` file excluding it
* Tina is configured with a branch that doesn't exist or a branch that doesn't contain the `tina` folder
  * The referenced branch should be created and should contain the `tina` folder
* The apiURL prop is misconfigured on the TinaCMS component
  * Check the apiURL and make sure it looks like `https://content.tinajs.io/content/{tina_client_id}/github/{branch}` where `{tina_client_id}` matches the Client ID on the Project in TinaCloud and `{branch}` is a valid branch

## GraphQL Schema Mismatch

If you are getting this error in your build logs, it means that the `tina/tina-lock.json` in your deployed site doesn't match the version that is in TinaCloud. To resolve it:

1. Ensure that your schema (generated from `tina/config.ts`) does not include any varying information, such as timestamps or random text
2. Ensure that you have the latest versions of `@tinacms/cli` and `tinacms` in your project
3. Run the dev command locally
4. Commit any changes to the `tina/tina-lock.json` and push those to the git repository linked in TinaCloud

If you are getting this error when access the TinaCMS interface, it can be caused by a mismatch between the version of `tinacms` and `@tinacms/cli` on the project. Update both dependencies to the latest versions and run the dev command locally. Commit any changes to the `tina/tina-lock.json` and push those to the git repository linked in TinaCloud.

## API URL Misformatted

The ContentAPI URL isn't formatted correctly. See [here](/docs/tinacloud/overview/#enabling-tina-cloud-in-tinacms) for information on how the URL *should* be formatted.

## Why Do I Need a Database When Using Markdown?

A database is essential when using markdown with TinaCMS because the Data Layer, which serves Markdown and JSON files, relies on a database to perform various content management functions. While the Markdown files are the primary source of your content, the database acts as a cache to enable advanced features like search, pagination, and cross-referencing between files. It also provides an API, allowing content fetching akin to traditional headless CMS operations.

Initially, TinaCMS's Data Layer operates unnoticed during local development and is managed by TinaCloud in production. With the introduction of self-hosted options, users can now opt for more control and customization, integrating their own authentication systems and hosting. The entire TinaCMS, including its Data Layer, is open-source, allowing for community-driven enhancements and support.
