## Failed Loading TinaCMS Assets

This error means that the TinaCMS admin HTML file failed to load the JavaScript bundle. This generally happens for a few reasons:

### User has pushed the development admin/index.html to production

When you run `tinacms dev` locally, Tina will generate a development admin/index.html file, which loads its assets from localhost. For production, this file should be built in CI using `tinacms build`. If a developer manually removes the admin/index.html file from their `.gitignore`, they may run into this issue.

### Your site is served on a different base path

If your site is served at a sub-directory, ensure that your `build.basePath` is [configured appropriately](/docs/reference/config/#definition)

## Vercel Deployment Issues

### Popup blocker prevents Vercel from installing their GitHub app

After choosing which starter template to deploy and being redirected to Vercel, a popup for Vercel to add their GitHub app may fail to open. Look in the bottom left corner for a toast message saying "The popup to install the GitHub App could not be opened."

To fix, check your browser's address bar for blocked popups, allow them, and retry.

## Accessing Local GraphQL Server

### In production

Make sure your API URL isn't set to point at your local GraphQL server when in production. You should be pointing to the ContentAPI.

### Locally

If you are working locally, make sure your [GraphQL server is running](/docs/graphql/cli/).
