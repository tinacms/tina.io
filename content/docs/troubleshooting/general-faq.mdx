A [certified developer](https://www.credly.com/org/superior-software-for-windows-ssw/badge/tinacms-developer) can accelerate the setup, fine-tune the configuration, and ensure best-practice architecture.

## Does TinaCloud only work with GitHub repositories?

Currently yes, the first Git provider that TinaCloud integrates with is GitHub. Other Git providers may be available in the future.

## Does TinaCloud work with Monorepos?

It does! TinaCloud can work with sites inside monorepos by specifying the path to your `tina` folder in your project configuration.

If your repo is not a monorepo, there's no need to do any configuration. We'll expect your `tina` folder at the root of your repo.

Here's an example monorepo structure that works with TinaCloud:

```
    /projects/site-a
    /projects/site-b
    /projects/site-c
```

See [Path To Tina](/docs/tinacloud/dashboard/projects/#path-to-tina) for more information.

## Do you support Git LFS?

Unfortunately we do not support Git LFS at this time due to limitations with the GitHub API.
