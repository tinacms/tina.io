## Usage

<WarningCallout body="This is an experimental feature, and the API is subject to change. Have any thoughts? Let us know in the chat or through one of our community channels. " />

Tables are supported through a custom template which is exported from `tinacms`. To use it, import it and provide it as a `template` for your `rich-text` field:

```ts
import { tinaTableTemplate } from 'tinacms'

{
  type: 'rich-text',
  label: 'Body',
  name: '_body',
  templates: [
    tinaTableTemplate,
  ]
}
```

Render it with the `table` component in `<TinaMarkdown>`. Note that the table cell's `value` is a rich-text element so should be rendered with a nested `<TinaMarkdown>` component:

```tsx

const MyTable = props => <table>
  {props.tableRows.map((tableRow) => (
    <tr>
      {tableRow.tableCells.map((tableCell) => (
        <td>
          <TinaMarkdown content={tableCell.value} />
        </td>
      ))}
    </tr>
  ))}
</table>

<TinaMarkdown components={{ table: (props) => <MyTable {...props} /> }} />
```
