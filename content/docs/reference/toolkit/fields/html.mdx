<WarningCallout body="This is an advanced-use feature, and likely not something you'll need to configure. What you probably want is the content types reference!" />


The `html` field represents a chunk of HTML content.

> **The `HtmlFieldPlugin` is not a default plugin.** See the [markdown](/docs/editing/markdown/#registering-the-field-plugins) docs for an example of how to use the `html` field in your website.
