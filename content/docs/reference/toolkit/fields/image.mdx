<WarningCallout body="This is an advanced-use feature, and likely not something you'll need to configure. What you probably want is the content types reference!" />

The `image` field is used for content values that point to an image used on the page. This field allows you to upload new images by via dragging or selection in Finder. Note this field does not handle any images included in the Markdown body, those would be handled by the [markdown](/docs/reference/toolkit/fields/markdown) component.

| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `component` | The name of the plugin component. Always `'image'`.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `clearable` | When true, editors can 'clear' the image field to an empty state via a trash icon. *(Optional)*                                                                                                                          |
| `uploadDir` | Defines the upload directory for the image. All of the form data is passed in, `fileRelativePath` is most useful in defining the upload directory, but you can also statically define the upload directory. *(Optional)* |
