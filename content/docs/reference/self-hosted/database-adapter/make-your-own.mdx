The database adapter accepts any [abstract-level](https://github.com/Level/abstract-level) implementation. To implement your own database adapter, you will need to extend the AbstractLevel class.

Here are some example level implementations:

- [upstash-redis-level](https://github.com/tinacms/upstash-redis-level)
- [mongodb-level](https://github.com/tinacms/mongodb-level)

See the [docs](https://github.com/Level/abstract-level#example) for more details on how to implement your own abstract-level database.
