Repo-based media storage is the default media storage solution for TinaCMS.

## Configuration

To configure repo-based media in your project, add the following to your schema definition in `tina/config.{ts,js}`

```ts
//tina/config.{ts,js}

export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  media: {
    tina: {
      publicFolder: 'public',
      mediaRoot: 'uploads',
    },
  },
})
```

### `publicFolder`

The path to your site's "public" folder. This path is relative to your project's root.

E.g, For any NextJS site, (such as our [tina-cloud-starter](https://github.com/tinacms/tina-cloud-starter/tree/main/public)), this value would be `"public"`

### `mediaRoot`

The path to your media folder, relative to the `publicFolder` value.

E.g, in our [tina-cloud-starter](https://github.com/tinacms/tina-cloud-starter/tree/main/public), this value would be `"uploads"`

> Note, anything in this directory will be synced with Tina Cloud's media server, and the images will be publicly accessible.

`mediaRoot` can be set to "", if you want your media to be uploaded to the root of your `publicFolder`.

### next/image

If you are using Next images, you will need to add the following to your `next.config.js` file to allow access to external images hosted on the Tina media hostname:

```js
module.exports = {
  images: {
    domains: ['assets.tina.io'],
  },
}
```

See the [next/image docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image#domains) for more information.

## Usage

Once media has been configured, you can use `image` fields in your collections.

In your `schema` add a new `image` field to a collection, e.g:

```ts
 // ...
 {
  name: 'hero',
  type: 'image',
  label: 'Hero Image',
 }
```

When your editors add an image to a document, the value that is saved will be a relative path:

`"/<mediaRoot>/<imgName>"`

> Not seeing your media? To see your media in the media manager, you will need to press the "Sync Media" button in the media manager. This will pull all of your media from Github and add it to TinaCMS.

## Branching Caveats

Repo-based media is designed to be used around a single-branch workflow. If your project is using the [experimental branching plugin](https://github.com/tinacms/tinacms/tree/main/packages/%40tinacms/toolkit/src/plugins/branch-switcher), there's some known caveats to be aware of.

* Images cannot be altered, once uploaded any subsequent changes to an asset will not be reflected.
* If you only have a single branch with media enabled, the media store will source/upload images to/from that branch.
* If you have multiple branches with media enabled, then all media will be sourced/uploaded to/from the repository's default branch.

If you are configuring Tina on a non-default branch (and the Tina config has not yet been merged to your default branch), you may see this message in the Tina Cloud media settings:\

\
To workaround this, you may need to enable media **after** merging Tina to your default branch.
