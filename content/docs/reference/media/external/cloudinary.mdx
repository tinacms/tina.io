Manage **Cloudinary media assets** in TinaCMS.

> The following guide uses NextJS's API functions to authenticate the 3rd-party media interactions. If you are using another framework with Vercel, this guide still applies (with a small tweak that you need to use `/api/...` instead of `/pages/api` for your Serverless function).

## Installation

```bash
yarn add next-tinacms-cloudinary @tinacms/auth
```

## Connect with Cloudinary

You need to provide your Cloudinary credentials to connect to your media library. Do [register on Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/users/register/free) if you don't have an account yet, your account details are displayed on the Cloudinary dashboard.

Add the following variables to an `.env` file.

```env
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=<Your Cloudinary Cloud Name>

CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=<Your Cloudinary API key>

CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=<Your Cloudinary API secret>
```

## Register the Media Store

Now, you can replace the default repo-based media with the external media store. You can register the Cloudinary Media store via the `loadCustomStore` prop.

The `loadCustomStore` prop can be configured within `tina/config.{js,ts}`.

```diff
//tina/config.{ts,js}

export default defineConfig({
  //...
  media: {
-    tina: {
-      publicFolder: 'public',
-      mediaRoot: 'uploads',
-    },
+    loadCustomStore: async () => {
+      const pack = await import("next-tinacms-cloudinary");
+      return pack.TinaCloudCloudinaryMediaStore;
+    },
  },
})
```

## Set up API routes

Tina's "external media provider" support requires a light backend media handler, that needs to be setup/hosted by the user. There are multiple ways to setup this handler:

### "NextJS API Routes"

For sites using NextJS, you can setup the handler as a NextJS Server function. To do so, create a `pages/api/cloudinary/[...media].ts` file in your project, with the following implementation:

```ts
// pages/api/cloudinary/[...media].ts

import {
  mediaHandlerConfig,
  createMediaHandler,
} from 'next-tinacms-cloudinary/dist/handlers'

import { isAuthorized } from '@tinacms/auth'

export const config = mediaHandlerConfig

export default createMediaHandler({
  cloud_name: process.env.CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME,
  api_key: process.env.CLOUDINARY_API_KEY,
  api_secret: process.env.CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET,
  authorized: async (req, _res) => {
    try {
      if (process.env.NODE_ENV == 'development') {
        return true
      }

      const user = await isAuthorized(req)

      return user && user.verified
    } catch (e) {
      console.error(e)
      return false
    }
  },
})
```

Here's what's happening in the above snippet:

- We call `createMediaHandler` to set up routes and connect your instance of the Media Store to your Cloudinary account.
- The `authorized` key will make it so only authorized users within Tina Cloud can upload and make media edits.

### Framework Agnostic implementations

In the above example, we showed how to host the backend handler as a NextJS API function. If you are using Vercel with another framework, the same approach applies (with the small difference that you need to use `/api/...` instead of `/pages/api/...` for your handler).

You can also check out our [Netlify Functions](/docs/reference/media/external/authentication/#option-3-netlify-functions) implementation.

## Update Schema

Now that the media store is registered and the API route for media set up, let's add an image to your schema.

In your `tina/config.{ts,tsx,js}` add a new field for the image, e.g:

```ts
 {
  name: 'hero',
  type: 'image',
  label: 'Hero Image',
 }
```

Now, when editing your site, the image field will allow you to connect to your Cloudinary account via the Media Store to manage your media assets.
