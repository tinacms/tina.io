title: Storing Images And Content Together

By default, TinaCMS expects:

* Markdown files in content/
* Images in public/uploads/

This separation works in many modern web frameworks (like Next.js, Astro, etc.) where static assets are served from a public directory, but it breaks **self-containment** — your content and its assets live in different locations.

This adds friction when managing, duplicating, or migrating content.

## Solution: Moving Your Content In The Media Folder

With this approach, both markdown and images are stored in public/uploads. The Tina Media Manager is configured to use this folder (it's the default), and each content item lives in its own subfolder.

Say you want to build a blog with posts, your file structure for the content would then look like this:

```
public/
└── uploads/
    └── posts/
        ├── post-a/
        │   ├── index.md
        │   └── image.png
```

> Note: `public/uploads` is the default Media folder, you can change it to be whatever suits your project.\
> See this for more information: [Repo-based Media](https://tina.io/docs/reference/media/repo-based#configuration)

The only thing required to make this work is to update the `path` in your Collection file to point to the Media folder.

### Considerations

* Markdown files live inside the Media folder - this is unconventional
* Content is publicly readable (like any static asset), so don't store sensitive information

### Conclusion

For projects using TinaCMS with modern frontend frameworks, keeping markdown and media together simplifies everything from authoring to deployment.

With the approach described here you get:

* ✅ No extra dev work
* ✅ Minimal config
* ✅ Media Manager works as expected
* ✅ Clean structure and great developer ergonomics
