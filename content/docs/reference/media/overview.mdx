TinaCMS provides multiple options for managing media.

All of the media configuration is done in the `defineConfig` function under `config.media`. For example:

```ts
export default defineConfig({
  //...
  schema: {
    collections: [
      // Array of collections
    ],
  },
  media: {
    // Media config
    tina: {
      // Repo-based Media config
    },
    // function that loads  the media store
    loadCustomStore: async () => {},
  },
  //.. Other config
})
```

> Note: Only Repo-based Media or an External Media Provider can be configured, but **not both**

## Repo-based Media (default)

With the built-in repo-based media option, media is stored within the site's repository.

Repo-based media keeps your assets alongside your content, making it easy to track changes and roll back versions for both code and media.

This approach simplifies workflows by eliminating the need for external media servers, as all updates happen within a unified system.

## External Media Providers

TinaCMS also supports pluggable external media providers.
