Based on the supported types table shown on the [previous page,](/docs/reference/media/repo-based) you can modify the accepted media types.

If you would like to specify your own allowed file types, add the following property to the media property in your defineConfig function. 

```javascript
//tina/config.{ts, js}

export default defineConfig({
  //...
  media: {
    tina: {
      //...
    },
    accept: ['image/jpeg', 'video/mp4'],
  },
})
```

### accept: List\<String>

This property determines the filetypes that can be uploaded

### next/image

If you are using Next images, you will need to add the following to your next.config.js file to allow access to external images hosted on the Tina media hostname 

```javascript
//next.config.js

module.exports = {
  images: {
    domains: ['assets.tina.io'],
  },
}
```
