A dedicated file input that stores the URL or path of an uploaded image.

It supports [external media library integration](/docs/reference/media/overview#external-media-providers), but also [repo-based media configurations](/docs/reference/media/repo-based).

Images can be uploaded to the image component with drag-and-drop actions, or with the dedicated media manager that comes with the CMS.

> To modify which types of files can be uploaded to the media manager, find the [list of supported file types](/docs/reference/media/repo-based#supported-media-types) and [how to override the default accepted media types](/docs/reference/media/overriding-accepted-media-types)

### Field with image path formatting

If you need to customize how an image is formatted in a field, you can use the `format` & `parse` options.

```js
{
  type: "image",
  name: "heroImg",
  label: "Hero Image",
  ui: {
    format(value) {
      //add leading slash to value if it doesnt exist
      return value.startsWith("/") ? value : `/${value}`;
    },
    parse(value) {
      //remove leading slash if it exists
      return value.startsWith("/") ? value.slice(1) : value;
    },
  }
}
```
