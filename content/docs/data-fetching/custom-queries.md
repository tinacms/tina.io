For most simple cases, you should be able to leverage the Tina Client's generated queries to do your data fetching:

```ts
const myPost = await client.queries.post({ relativePath: 'HelloWorld.md' })
```

In more advanced cases, you may want more control on the underlying GraphQL query. In these cases you have two options:

- Extending the autogenerated `client.queries`, by writing a custom query.
- Use `client.request`, and write an inline query.

## Extending the autogenerated `client.queries`

The client can be extended to perform more advanced queries (including querying multiple root collections at once), by adding queries to the `.tina/queries` directory.

Example of `.tina/queries/queries.gql`

```ts
query postWithNav($relativePath: String!) {
  nav(relativePath: "nav.json") {
    ...NavParts
  }
  post(relativePath: $relativePath) {
    ...PostParts
  }
}
```

We are using a `PostParts` & `NavParts` Fragment here. For each collection, this fragment is generated and updated when the schema is updated. You can view any available Fragments for your schema in `/.tina/__generated__/frags.gql`.

Once the query is added, the client will have its types updated so that it can be used to request the new query.

```js
import { client } from '../pathToTina/.tina/client'

// Use the client to perform data fetching
// Here, it fetches a single "post" item
const myPost = await client.queries.postWithNav({
  relativePath: 'HelloWorld.md',
})

console.log(myPost.title)
console.log(myPost.nav.items)
```

## Writing inline queries

If you want to avoid using the types on the client altogether, you can also just write an inline query using the `client.request` function.

```js
import { client } from '../pathToTina/.tina/client'

// Use the client to perform data fetching
// Here, it fetches a single "post" item
const myPost = await client.request({
  query: `query getPost($relativePath: String!) {
      post(relativePath: $relativePath) {
        title
        body
      }
    `,
  variables: { relativePath: 'hello-world.md' },
})

console.log(myPost.title)
```
