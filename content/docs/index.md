**Tina** contains multiple tools and applications designed to improve collaboration between **content writers** and **developers** who work on web content. Under the umbrella of Tina, there are two main components:

- The **TinaCMS toolkit**, a suite of NPM packages that enable developers to quickly create a custom content management frontend for a website.
- **Tina Cloud**, a hosted service designed to make Git-based content management more powerful and accessible for cross-functional teams.

## TinaCMS Toolkit

The **TinaCMS Toolkit** empowers developers to build a visual editing experience directly on their sites. By creating a custom editing experience with Tina instead of opting for a conventional CMS, developers can give their teams a contextual, intuitive editing experience without sacrificing code quality.

## Tina Cloud

**Tina Cloud** is a hosted service purpose built for integration with the TinaCMS Toolkit. Tina Cloud makes it possible for entire content teams to take advantage of a Git-based workflow, regardless of whether they write code or have GitHub accounts. Additionally, Tina Cloud exposes a GraphQL API for your site's file-based content, giving developers a more powerful interface for querying data and reconciling relationships.
