**Tina** contains multiple tools and applications designed to improve collaboration between **content writers** and **developers** who work on web content. Under the umbrella of Tina, there are two main components:

- **Tina Cloud**, a hosted service designed to make Git-based content management more powerful and accessible for cross-functional teams.
- The **TinaCMS toolkit**, a suite of packages that enable developers to quickly create a custom visual editing experience for content writers.

## Tina Cloud

**Tina Cloud** is a hosted service purpose built for integration with the TinaCMS Toolkit. Tina Cloud makes it possible for entire content teams to take advantage of a Git-based workflow, regardless of whether they write code or have GitHub accounts. Additionally, Tina Cloud exposes a GraphQL API for your site's file-based content, giving developers a more powerful interface for querying data and reconciling relationships.

[Tina Cloud Dashboard](/docs/tina-cloud/dashboard/) - The Tina Cloud Dashboard is the interface for managing the administrative aspects of your content management. The dashboard allows you to create apps, and setup your users.

## TinaCMS Toolkit

The **TinaCMS Toolkit** empowers developers to build a visual editing experience directly on their sites. By creating a custom editing experience with Tina instead of opting for a conventional CMS, developers can give their teams a contextual, intuitive editing experience without sacrificing code control.

## Guides

Our **Guides** section contains various step-by-step guides to show you how to use Tina. We believe guides are opportunities for learning, and we will introduce you you to certain APIs, configurations, or workflows and provide rudimentary examples for your reference.
