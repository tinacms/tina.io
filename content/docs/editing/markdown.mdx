Markdown `(.md)` and MDX `(.mdx)` are two popular formats for authoring content. Tina works great with both formats, and provides a simple WYSIWYG editor (so your editors won't have to manually write any markup).

### What is markdown?

A basic `.md` might look like this:

```md
---
title: This is my title
---

## Knock Knock!

Who's there?
```

The fields registered in between the `---` delimiters, are called your **frontmatter**. Anything below is your **markdown body**.

### What is MDX?

MDX is similar to Markdown, however it adds the ability to write JSX (react) components in your **markdown body**.

```md
---
title: This is my title
---

## Knock Knock!

Who's there?

<PunchLine text="orange your glad I didn't say banana?" />
```
