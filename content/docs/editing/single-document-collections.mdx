## Overview

In Tina, single-document collections refer to collections that can only accommodate a solitary document. In the UI, achieving this can be accomplished by disabling the creation and deletion buttons through setting `ui.allowedActions.create` and `ui.allowedActions.delete` to false. For more information, please refer to the [Collection Reference](/docs/reference/collections/ "Collection reference").

```javascript
export default defineConfig({
  collections: [
    {
      label: 'Site Settings',
      name: 'siteSettings',
      path: 'content/settings',
      format: 'json',
      fields: [
        {
          type: 'string',
          label: 'Site Title',
          name: 'title',
        },
      ],
      ui: {
        allowedActions: {
          create: false,
          delete: false,
        },
      },
    },
  ],
});
```

Once both settings have been applied, and the document contains a single file, the UI will forego the list page and direct the user straight to the document.

## Caveats

At present, query generation isn't available, meaning you'll need to craft your [custom query](/docs/data-fetching/custom-queries/ "Custom Query Docs").

It's worth noting that setting `ui.allowedActions` merely modifies the user interface. If you'd like to prevent the API from adding more files to the collection, you can do so by utilizing the `match` property, as detailed in the [Collection Docs](/docs/reference/collections/#matchinclude).

```javascript
match: {
  include: 'documentName'
}
```

By implementing this, new documents will be prevented from being created.
