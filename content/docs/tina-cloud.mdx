To deploy your site to production, you'll need to connect Tina to a hosted backend. This doc will walk you through the steps to get your site from [running locally to running for production](/docs/tina-cloud/faq/#what-is-local-mode-vs-prod-mode).

<!-- Tina's GraphQL Content API is flexible, in that it can be run locally using the Tina CLI ("Local Mode") which persists changes to the local file system, or your site can talk to a hosted content API in a production environment ("Prod Mode"), which persists changes to your GitHub repository. -->
