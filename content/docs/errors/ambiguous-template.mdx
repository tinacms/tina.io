This error happens when a collection uses templates and there is no template key found in the document. It is common for this to happen when migrating from fields to templates or during forestry migration.

## How to fix

This error can be fixed by adding a root level field of \_template to every document with this error.  There is not currently any way to automatically migrate the content and it must be done manually or with custom scripts.

Ex:
If you had a markdown file you would add:

```markdown
---
_template: templateName
---
```

Where `templateName` is the name of the template in your collection

If it was a JSON file it would look like this.

```json
{
  "_template": "templateName",
}
```

etc.
