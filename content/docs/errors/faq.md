## Invalid or undefined branch

The current branch that Tina is using is invalid or undefined. Double check that the correct branch is selected and it does in fact exist.

## tina directory not pushed to git

The `tina` directory and everything inside, including the `__generated__` directory, needs to be pushed up as well. Be sure to add it to your git repository (and make sure you **don't** have it listed in a `.gitignore`). And also make sure that the branch you're trying to use has the `tina` directory and is up to date.

## API URL is misformatted

The ContentAPI URL isn't formatted correctly. See [here](/docs/tina-cloud/connecting-site/#enabling-tina-cloud-in-tinacms) for information on how the URL _should_ be formatted.

## Trying to access local GraphQL server when it's not running or in prod.

#### In production

Make sure your API URL isn't set to point at your local GraphQL server when in production. You should be pointing to the ContentAPI.

#### Working locally

If you are working locally, make sure your GraphQL server is running. See [here](/docs/graphql/cli/) for more information.

## Document doesn't exist

Double check you aren't trying to access a document that doesn't exist.
