title: 'ESbuild compilation and build errors'
---

The `tina/config.{ts,js,tsx}` file is built with [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) and executed in a node.js runtime. This allows you to import from outside your `.tina` folder and esbuild will handle this for us. This also can run into some edge cases where some things are being run on the server that should not be.

## ERROR: your schema was not successfully built

This means that there was a syntax or semantic error somewhere in your code. This could be inside the .tina folder or in any file that was imported from your schema file.

## ERROR: your config.{ts,js} was not successfully executed

This error means that the schema was compiled correctly (correct syntax) but when the code was run it produced an error.

Some common issues are

- Importing code that requires a custom compile logic (webpack loader, esbuild loader, babel plugin, etc)
- Importing and running code that needs to be run on the frontend (uses `window`, DOM APIs, etc)

If you run into one of the above issues you can try only importing the code that you need.

For example you might have

```ts
import { TinaHeroTemplate } from '../components/'
```

which could be switched to

```ts
import { TinaHeroTemplate } from '../components/blocks/hero'
```

Using this more specific path means it is less likely that you will run into errors
