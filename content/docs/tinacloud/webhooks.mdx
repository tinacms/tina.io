If you need to automate tasks or trigger external processes when your content
is updated, you can leverage the webhooks feature. When content is pushed
or modified to a specific branch, TinaCMS sends a notification to your
server. The payload includes the paths of the modified files, enabling event driven actions like rebuilding your site or populating a search index.

## Setting Up

Webhooks can be created via the "Webhooks" tab within a project.

To create a webhook, follow these steps:

1. Go to the project.
2. Click Webhooks | Add Webhook
3. Enter a name, server URL, target branches and additional headers to be sent to the your server.

# Webhook Logs

Webhook logs can be found within **Webhooks | Logs**.

Each log entry includes:
- **Date**: Timestamp of the webhook request.
- **Status**: HTTP status code returned.
- **Request**: Payload sent (see Requests)
- **Response**: Body returned from your server.

## Requests

Below is an example webhook request payload:

```
{
    clientId: "276...",
    branch: "main",
    paths: ["content/authors/bob", ...],
    type: "content.modified",
    eventId: "472..."
}
```

> Note: The payload `type` can be of either `['content.modified' |
> 'content.removed' | 'content.added']`
