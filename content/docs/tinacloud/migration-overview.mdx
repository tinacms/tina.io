## Moving TinaCloud to Beta

Thanks for participating in the TinaCloud Alpha! Because of you we were able to gather a ton of useful feedback, identify pain points,
and get a good idea about how real people will use TinaCloud in the future.

We've made a few changes and are ready to make a TinaCloud beta publicly available.

## Dashboard changes

We've refreshed the TinaCloud dashboard and made some stable improvements along the way. You'll need to recreate your organization to get the upgrade. [Learn how](/docs/tina-cloud/beta-migration/)

## Schema migration

We've also implemented a new and improved `defineConfig` API, along with many API improvements for working with Next.js. [Learn how to migrate](/docs/tina-cloud/schema-migration)

Also, be sure to check out the detailed API references, including an [interactive GraphQL playground!](/docs/graphql/overview/)
