## Overview

TinaCloud's authentication and content services communicate with several external domains. If your network uses a firewall, VPN, or proxy that restricts outbound traffic, you will need to whitelist the domains listed below to ensure TinaCMS functions correctly.

## Required Domains

### TinaCloud Services

| Domain | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `*.tina.io` | TinaCloud dashboard and asset delivery |
| `identity.tinajs.io` | Authentication and identity services |
| `content.tinajs.io` | Content API and data layer |
| `assets.tinajs.io` | Asset management and delivery |

### Authentication (OAuth / SSO)

TinaCloud uses AWS Cognito and API Gateway for authentication. The login flow redirects through these domains during sign-in:

| Domain | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `*.auth.us-east-1.amazoncognito.com` | AWS Cognito hosted UI (OAuth authorization) |
| `cognito-idp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com` | AWS Cognito Identity Provider API |
| `*.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com` | AWS API Gateway (OIDC identity bridge) |

### GitHub

If your project uses GitHub as its git provider (the default for TinaCloud):

| Domain | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `github.com` | GitHub OAuth authorization and repository access |
| `api.github.com` | GitHub API for token exchange and user info |

### Enterprise SSO (WorkOS)

If your organization uses enterprise SSO through TinaCloud:

| Domain | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `*.workos.com` | WorkOS enterprise SSO provider |

## Troubleshooting

### Login times out on VPN or restricted network

If you see a "Login attempt timed out" error when authenticating from a VPN or restricted network, it is likely that one of the authentication domains listed above is being blocked. The sign-in flow must complete a full redirect chain within 20 seconds, and any blocked domain in that chain will cause a timeout.

### Content Security Policy (CSP)

If you are configuring Content Security Policy headers for your site, see the [CSP Configuration guide](/docs/guides/csp-configuration/) for the required directives.
