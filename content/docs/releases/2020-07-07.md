This marks the second week of the TinaCMS team's cool down period. Next week we will be announcing a set of new projects that we'll be taking on in the following 6 weeks.

In the meantime, here's a few updates to the project

## Changes

### **tinacms**

- `cms.enable()` and `cms.disable()` are now lamdas which makes it easier for them to be used as `onClick` handlers.

### **react-tinacms-editor**

- Fixed a bug which caused the editor history to be lost when focus was lost

### **react-tinacms-github**

- Updated documentation to reflect changes to APIs in the previous release.
- Add`getDownloadUrl` for previewing media
- Media can now be overwritten
- Allows leading slashes in paths
- Introduced `GithubFile` and `useGithubFile`. Docs coming soon.
- Introduced new event: `github:commit`

### **next-tinacms-github**

- Send more helpful error messages when preview mode cannot be enabled
