This week we've continued our efforts at improving the documentation! Here are a few highlights

- Added a new [404 Page](/some-invalid-url)
- Put a "Last Edited" timestamp on docs and blog posts. We even used Tina to automatically update the date whenever changes are made to a doc.
- Has our first couple [coffee chats](https://community.tinacms.org/t/feedback-for-the-tina-team/276) with TinaCMS community members.

### Upgrading from v0.25.0

#### The CMS object is no longer enabled by default

If you were creating the CMS like this:

```ts
const cms = new TinaCMS()
```

Then the CMS would have been enabled (i.e. the eidting UI would be available).

This is no longer the case so you will have to switch to:

```ts
const cms = new TinaCMS({ enabled: true })
```
