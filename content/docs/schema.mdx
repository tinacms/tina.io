## Defining "collections"

Each item in your `collections` array represents its own entity. In the above example, we defined a `post` collection, and set its path as `content/posts`, which maps to a directory in our site's repository. Each collection contains an array of `fields`, that each have a defined `type`.

```md
---
title: This is my title
---

This is my main post body.
```

> Note: The `isBody` property is used to output a given field to the markdown body, instead of its frontmatter.

Once we've defined a collection, we can edit its fields through the Tina UI, or [query its content](/docs/graphql/overview/) using the Tina Content API.

## Grouping properties as an "object"

An object type takes either a `fields` or `templates` property (just like the `collections` definition). The simplest kind of `object` is one with `fields`:

```js
// ...
fields: [
  {
    label: 'Testimonial',
    name: 'testimonial',
    type: 'object',
    fields: [
      {
        label: 'Author',
        name: 'author',
        type: 'string',
      },
      {
        label: 'Role',
        name: 'role',
        type: 'string',
      },
      {
        label: 'Quote',
        name: 'quote',
        type: 'string',
        ui: {
          component: 'textarea',
        },
      },
    ],
  },
]
// ...
```

Setting `list: true` would turn the values into an array.

> More complex shapes can be built by using the [`templates`](/docs/reference/types/object/#with-multiple-templates) property. This allows your editors to build out pages using predefined blocks.

## Referencing another document

The `reference` field connects one document to another and only needs to be defined on *one* side of the relationship. You can specify any number of collections you'd like to connect:

```js
// ...
fields: [
  // ...
  {
    label: 'Author',
    name: 'author',
    type: 'reference',
    collections: ['author'], // points to a collection with the name "author"
  },
]
//
```

## Available data types

Each field in a collection can be of the following `type`:

### *scalar types*

* [string](/docs/reference/types/string/)
* [datetime](/docs/reference/types/datetime/)
* [boolean](/docs/reference/types/boolean/)
* [image](/docs/reference/types/image/)
* [number](/docs/reference/types/number/)

### *nonscalar types*

* [reference](/docs/reference/types/reference/)
* [object](/docs/reference/types/object/)
* [rich-text](/docs/reference/types/rich-text/)

## Summary

* Your content is modeled in the `tina/config.{ts,js,tsx}` in your repo using `defineConfig`.
* Your content model contains an array of "collections". A "collection" maps a content type to a directory in your repo.
* A "collection" contains multiple fields, which can be of multiple scalar or non-scalar data types.
