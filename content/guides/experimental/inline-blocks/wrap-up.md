That's it! We have successfully set up Inline Editing and a nice set of Inline Blocks. By now you should be feeling more comfortable working with the Inline Editing API and creating blocks of your own.

> Checkout the branch with the [final state](https://github.com/tinacms/inline-blocks-demo/tree/final-state) of the demo created in this guide.

Please reference [the documentation](https://tinacms.org/docs/ui/inline-editing) to dive deeper into these APIs.

If you run into issues, post your questions on the [Tina Forum](https://community.tinacms.org/). If you have ideas on features to add or ways to improve Inline Editing, [open an issue](https://github.com/tinacms/tinacms/issues) in GitHub.

We'd love to see what you make, **tweet us your block creations** [@tina_cms](https://twitter.com/tina_cms) ðŸ¦™!
