title: Set up the GitHub OAuth App
---

To get started, we need to set up an OAuth App in Github. Within your GitHub Account Settings, click <a href="https://github.com/settings/developers" target="_blank">OAuth Apps</a> under Developer Settings. Go ahead and create a "New OAuth App".

Since you are **testing your app locally**, you'll create a _development_ GitHub app that redirects to localhost. Eventually you'll need to create separate OAuth Apps: one for development and a production app whose URLs will connect to the live domain. We'll circle back to the production app once when we cover [hosting](/guides/nextjs/github-open-authoring/hosting-vercel).

For now, fill in `http://localhost:3000` for the _Homepage URL_. With the **Authorization callback URL**, enter `http://localhost:3000/github/authorizing`. This is the URL for an authorizing redirect page that we will create at a [later step](/guides/nextjs/github-open-authoring/auth-redirect).

Once the details are filled in, Go ahead and click 'Register Application'. After creating the app, you should see a page with information such as **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. Next, we'll add those as environment variables to the project to connect this App to the Tina-GitHub helpers.

### Setting Environment Variables

[Environment variables](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next.config.js/environment-variables) are sensitive values specific to your project. The Tina-GitHub helpers will use these values to talk to your repository, enabling auth and data fetching via GitHub.

To set these variables, create a `.env` file in your project root. Add the _secret_ and _id_ values from the OAuth App, and fill in the repo name.

> **Do not commit this file!** You will want to add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file.

**.env**

```
# OAuth App Credentials from GitHub
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=

# The path to your repository in GitHub
REPO_FULL_NAME=my-github-user/my-github-repo

# The base branch that new changes and forks are created from. Defaults to 'master'.
BASE_BRANCH=master
```

You can use the `dotenv` package to load the `.env` file:

```bash
yarn add dotenv
```

Now, to load these `.env` values in the front-end, create a file called [next.config.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next.config.js/introduction) in the root of your project. Add the code from this example:

**next.config.js**

```js
require('dotenv').config()

module.exports = {
  env: {
    GITHUB_CLIENT_ID: process.env.GITHUB_CLIENT_ID,
    REPO_FULL_NAME: process.env.REPO_FULL_NAME,
    BASE_BRANCH: process.env.BASE_BRANCH,
  },
  // ...
}
```

> Note that we did not add `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` to the exported configuration. Environment variables we add here are [injected by Webpack at build time](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next.config.js/environment-variables) and will be present in the JavaScript bundle sent to the client. Since `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` will only be used in our server-side code, and we don't want it exposed to the client, we will avoid adding it here.

Our GitHub App is up and running! Next, we will set up some API functions to handle content editing.
