Tina is a **toolkit for building visual editing** into your site. This tutorial will walk you through Tina's fundamental building blocks by setting up editing on a basic `create-react-app` [demo](https://github.com/tinacms/tina-intro-tutorial). **To get the most from Tina, you should have a good working knowledge of JavaScript and React**.

## Why _create-react-app_?

Tina's UI is built with React. Using Tina in a plain React App is the simplest way to get familiar with Tina without relying on helper packages or meta-frameworks. Understanding the core concepts introduced in this tutorial will set you up for success later down the line.

**If this is your first time working with Tina**, we suggest going through this short tutorial.
