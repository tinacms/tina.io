The Tina Cloud Starter is a simple Tina Cloud-enabled Next.js application. Not only can you visually edit your content in real-time, but since this starter is powered by Tina's GraphQL API, TinaCMS forms are automatically generated for you, all you need to do is to define your content schema ✨.

By the end of this guide, your whole team will be able to edit on a deployed version of your site — we recommend using Vercel.

Invited users don't need a GitHub account, users management is entirely handled through Tina Cloud.
