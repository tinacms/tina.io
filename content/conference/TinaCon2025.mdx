      Managing content shouldn’t be a chaotic mess of outdated files, endless
      email threads, or confusing version names. Whether you're working on
      blogs, documentation, or even entire websites, GitHub offers a powerful
      yet often underutilised way to streamline your workflow.   Let's explore
      how GitHub can revolutionise content management—from version control and
      collaboration to automated publishing. You'll learn practical techniques
      like how to use branching, pull requests for content reviews, and how to
      effectively collaborate. We'll also look at some real-world uses,
      including static site generators, and headless CMS integrations.   Whether
      you're a developer, tech writer, or content creator, this talk will give
      you the tools to manage web content like a pro.   In this talk, I'll
      cover: ✅ What is version control and why use it ✅ What is GitHub ✅
      Challenges in content management ✅ Version control for content ✅ Pull
      requests and reviews ✅ GitHub Actions for automatic deployment ✅ Markdown
      and static sites ✅ Headless CMS and GitHub ✅ Avoiding common mistakes ✅
      Power-user GitHub features
