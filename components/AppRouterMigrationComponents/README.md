**TEMPORARY README**

The directory `components/AppRouterMigrationComponents/` contains components currently used in the
pages router implementation of the site but modified to fit the client server pattern of the app router.

All components created, and used in the AppRouter implementation are temporarily stored in this directory

Once the migration from pages to app router is finished the old components in the `components/` directory will be deleted and the components from `components/AppRouterMigrationComponents/` will be moved out of the `AppRouterMigrationComponents/` directory back in to the `components/` directory so that there are **no duplicate components**
