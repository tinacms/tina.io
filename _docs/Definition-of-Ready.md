# Definition Of Ready

Prior to being actioned, an issue in this repository should at minimum contain...

- Enough detail for the team (or future teams) to action
- Effort assigned (we use the [SSW recomendation](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/estimating-do-you-know-how-to-size-user-stories-effectively/) for business and effort value estimates).

    ...possible efforts are 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 with each point of effort corresponding to a quarter day (~2 hours). Larger tasks should be done over multiple PBIs.
- We're not using business values for this project. 
- Assigned to `backlog ready` with PO approval.
